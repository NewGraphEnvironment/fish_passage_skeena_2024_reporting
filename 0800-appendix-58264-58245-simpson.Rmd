## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)`, `r as.character(my_site3)`, and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 3km northwest of Smithers, BC. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, and is located south of the mapped channel. Simpson Creek flows into Kathlyn Creek, which joins the Bulkley River approximalety 4km downstream. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located 70m upstream of the confluence of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` and Kathlyn Creek, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`. Approximately 530 m upstream, crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` is located on and is the responsibility of the Canadian National Railway. A further 950m upstream, crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`. The `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` and `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and all crossing are within the Bulkley River watershed group.

<br>


## Background {.unnumbered}

At this location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-58264)). Simpson Creek is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the 2024 assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem.

<br>

In 2012, PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments by Marlim Ecological Consulting Ltd. and both were ranked as barriers [@marlimecologicalconsultingltd_2013FishPassage]. 

<br>

Historically, Simpson Creek has been a spawning location for coho salmon. Since 1986, coho have been transplanted into the Kathlyn Creek system from the Toboggan Creek Hatchery [@gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish]. Kathlyn Creek also supports a small population of pink salmon, and steelhead are known to inhabit Kathlyn Lake and spawn upstream of the Chicken Creek confluence, which would include areas near the Simpson Creek confluence [@gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish]. Adjacent to the crossing on Nielson Road (`r as.character(my_site2)`), coho salmon and other salmonids have been documented in the past, along with cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, steelhead, mountain whitefish, and Dolly Varden [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. Approximately 360 m downstream of Nielson Road, the adjacent landowner has observed recent steelhead and coho spawning and historically chinook spawning. 

<br>

According to a nearby landowner, the crossing on Nielson Road (`r as.character(my_site2)`) was originally a bridge but was replaced with the current culvert during an emergency flood event in the 1990s. Materials from the flood were used to construct dikes upstream and downstream of the crossing, which remained in place at the time of the 2024 assessment. Upstream of the Nielson Road crossing, a trail runs parallel to the stream for 400m up to the power line, offering an excellent opportunity for community engagement. By connecting people to the land, the trail can foster stewardship and advocacy for the stream, potentially leading to future restoration efforts.

Habitat modelling outputs from `bcfishpass` indicated 1.6km of steelhead and 1.4km of coho rearing habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` (gradients <8.5% for steelhead and <5.5% for coho). Upstream of the crossing on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`, only 100m of habitat is modelled for steelhead and coho rearing due to a steeper stream gradient exceeding 8.5%. Outputs are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-58245)). A map of the watershed is provided in

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)`, `r as.character(my_site3)`, and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and although it ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol, neither of the two culverts at this location had an outlet drop, therefore it is unlikely a barrier to fish passage [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58245)).

<br>

Approximately 530 m upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` on the CN `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site3)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site3, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-203122)). The two culverts were roughly 30 m apart, the southern pipe was dry and fully embedded, while the northern pipe was currently conveying the main flow of Simpson Creek.

<br>

A further 950m upstream, PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58264)). This concrete oval culvert had a significant 1 m outlet drop and 1.2 m deep outlet pool. 

<br>

At all crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`, to the confluence with Kathlyn Creek. The stream ran adjacent to the road along one bank, which had limited riparian vegetation consisting primarily of shrubs. The opposite bank, bordered by private property, had minimal vegetation and no significant riparian cover. Multiple sections of bank armouring and channelization were observed near the private property, and only small pockets of gravels suitable for spawning were observed `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from Lake Kathlyn Road (crossing `r as.character(my_site)`) to the CN railway (crossing `r as.character(my_site3)`), a distance of approximately 650m. Above Lake Kathlyn Road, the stream was heavily impacted by adjacent private lands, with riparian vegetation removed, the stream channelized, and banks armoured `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-d01))."))` Extensive beaver activity was observed in the lower stream, with dams ranging in height from 0.4 to 1 m. Nearing the railway crossing, the stream consisted of mostly intact riparian vegetation, abundant gravels, deep pools, and large woody debris. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid spawning and rearing.

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site4)`, situated approximately 70m upstream of Lake Kathlyn Road, was also assessed during the survey, with the culvert assessment provided in [Appendix 1](#appendix1). The crossing consisted of three 0.95m pipes running beneath a private driveway, with two pipes appearing fully embedded. The crossing was non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_phase1, col_filter = my_crossing_reference, site = 2024092003, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment]. Evidence of beaver activity was observed including debris accumulation at the inlet, and the landowner reported previous blockages caused by beavers, which required periodic inlet clearing and the removal of significant accumulated material through dredging.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from the CN railway (crossing `r as.character(my_site3)`) to `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` (crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`), a distance of approximately 950m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d01))."))` From the railway crossing upstream, the gradient was low (2–3%), with high-quality habitat characterized by abundant gravels, deep pools up to 90cm, large woody debris, and diverse cover. In this section, the adjacent landowner reported recent steelhead and coho spawning, as well as historical Chinook spawning. Approximately 300m downstream of Nielson Road, the gradient increased (5–6%), transitioning into straight riffle-cascade sections with confined, channelized, dyke-like banks. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site3, loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site3, loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid spawning and rearing. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`. This section of the stream featured a steeper gradient, predominantly characterized by boulder cover with occasional pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d01))."))` Pools were infrequent throughout. The riparian zone was composed of a healthy, mature mixed forest, providing stability and shading. The upper end of the site was situated just upstream of a short cascade with a 20% gradient. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing an spawning. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` 

<br>
 
## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58264) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58264) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-58264). A total of `r tab_fish_summary |>filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds')) |>filter(ef == "ef1") |>  group_by(site_id) |>janitor::adorn_totals() |>filter(site_id == 'Total') |>pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrid, and Dolly Varden. Upstream of the crossing `r tab_fish_summary |>filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_us')) |>group_by(site_id) |>janitor::adorn_totals() |>filter(site_id == 'Total') |>pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d02))."))` . 

<br>

Electrofishing was conducted at one site approximately 360 m downstream of Nielsen Road, with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58264) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58264) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-58264). At this location, the adjacent landowner had reported recent steelhead and coho spawning and historically Chinook spawning. A total of `r tab_fish_summary |>filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds')) |>filter(ef == "ef2") |>  group_by(site_id) |>janitor::adorn_totals() |>filter(site_id == 'Total') |>pull(count_fish)` fish were captured including coho salmon, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrid, and Dolly Varden `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d02))."))`


<br>


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Nielson Road crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. The significant 1 m outlet drop at this crossing, combined with the presence of salmonids in the system, makes it a top priority for remediation. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` on the CN Railway presented a minimal barrier to fish passage and is considered a low priority for replacement. However, if restoration activities are undertaken, replacing the existing structure with a bridge spanning `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site3, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m is recommended. As of 2025, the estimated replacement cost is \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site3), big.mark = ',')`, with the high cost attributed to the complexities of working within a railway corridor. 

<br>

At the time of assessment, the downstream crossing on Lake Kathlyn Road was unlikely a barrier to fish passage. However, should restoration activities proceed, replacement with a bridge spanning `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>



## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Simpson Creek is a significant contributor to the Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the 2024 assessment slightly less than those observed in the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid spawning and rearing. Simpson Creek has historically supported a variety of salmonids, and coho captured during electrofishing at the time of assessment further confirm the stream’s continued importance as salmonid habitat. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` on Nielsen Road is a strong candidate for remediation, given its large outlet drop (1m) and low traffic volume, it is a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement. Upstream of this crossing, a trail runs alongside the stream offering opportunities for community engagement and education, which could foster stewardship and advocacy for the stream. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` on the CN Railway presented a minimal barrier at the time of assessment and was considered a low priority for replacement. However, if restoration activities proceed at the upstream crossing on Nielsen Road, this crossing should be reassessed. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on Lake Kathlyn Road is not presumed to be a significant barrier to fish passage and was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement. However, the culverts were heavily corroded and located in an area impacted by riparian vegetation removal, stream channelization, and bank armouring, which presents a valuable opportunity for community-led restoration efforts and education. The proximity of these sites to Smithers, BC, enhances opportunities for public involvement and education, further supporting long-term restoration goals for Simpson Creek.

# Buck Falls - Appendix {-#buck-falls}

Buck falls are located just downstream of the Buck Flats Road bridge on the Buck Creek mainstem - mapped in the freshwater atlas as
46.7km upstream of its confluence with the Bulkley River. The falls have not yet been documented in the FISS database [@moe2024ProvincialObstacles] but have been previously noted in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish, the World Waterfall Database [@BuckFallsBritishColumbiaCanadaWorldWaterfallDatabase], and on the Houston Hikers website [@BuckFallsAdventures]. Although rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, kokannee and other non-salmonid resident species have been documented upstream of the falls in the FISS database - no salmon species have been documented upstream [@moe2024KnownBC]. However, @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage report Neelhdzii Teezdlii Ceek as historic Wet’suwet’en traditional fisheries location upstream approximately 
24km (stream length) upstream of Buck Falls at the outlet of Goosly Lake. Species noted as captured upstream of the falls
at Neelhdzii Teezdlii Ceek include coho salmon and chinook salmon.  An assessment of the falls was conducted on September 19, 2024.

The falls consist of a series of three separate vertical and cascade sections over and approximately 200m section of stream. The upper falls consisted of a ~4 m high vertical drop, presenting a substantial barrier to fish passage `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-d01))."))` Approximately 25 m downstream, the second falls was a ~3.5 m high sheer drop to bedrock, with minimal pool depth available to facilitate fish passage `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-d01))."))` Further downstream ~100 m, the third step comprised a ~1.5 m vertical drop with an overlying cascade, exhibiting a ~15% gradient over a 1.0 m height `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-d02))."))` An additional cascade, located a further ~25 m downstream, featured a ~2 m high drop with a ~30% gradient extending over a 5 m length `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-buck-d02))."))`

Although the size of the documented drops indicate that it is highly unlikely that any species or life stage of salmon
can easily ascend the sequence of drops associated with Buck Falls, documentation of Neelhdzii Teezdlii Ceek as a 
historic Wet’suwet’en traditional fisheries location upstream of Buck Falls suggests that the falls were
passed by salmon in the past and may again ascend in the future (personal communications - Kenny Rabnett - local fisheries
biologist and legend).

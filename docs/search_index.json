"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) has been actively involved in planning, coordinating, and conducting fish passage restoration efforts within the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups, which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. In 2022, the study area was expanded to include the Zymoetz River watershed group and the Kispiox River watershed group, followed by an extension in 2023 to encompass sections of the Kitsumkalum River watershed group, particularly where Highway 16 intersects the watershed. The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within these study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment. Although the main purpose of this report is to document 2024 field work data and results, it also builds on reporting from field activities conducted from 2020 to 2023. In addition to the numerous assessments at sites undocumented in past years of the project, field activities were also conducted 3 sites where habitat confirmations were previously documented as per the report links below. The reports for these sites were edited and updated with 2024 data.

Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked with the changelog section. Additionally, issues and planned enhancements are tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan Gitxsan means “People of the River Mist”. The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” n.d.). Many band members live in Hazelton, Kispiox and Glen Vowell (the Eastern Gitxsan) as well as within Kitwanga, Kitwankool and Kitsegukla (the Western Gitxsan) (Powell, Jensen, and Pedersen 2018). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. # The original Gitxsan economy depended heavily on the trade of fish and other natural resources with neighbouring First Nations along &quot;grease trails,&quot; which are routes named so because they carried the refined oil of the oolichan, a fish that resembles a smelt that is common in some areas of British Columbia. They are also known for their range of traditional arts 2.3 Tsimshian The Kitsumkalum community, part of the Tsimshian Nation, maintains a rich cultural heritage rooted in ancient traditions and values. Their society, governed by Tsimshian Law (ayaawx), emphasizes strong connections through marriages, adoptions, and resource sharing with other Tsimshian tribes. The community upholds its cultural and spiritual practices, including fishing, harvesting, and land stewardship, despite the impacts of colonization (Kitsumkalum Band n.d.). Kitsumkalum’s social structure is based on matrilineal kinship, with significant emphasis on family ties through the mother’s lineage. Their cultural identity is expressed through crest groups (pteex), lineage houses (waap), and the importance of landed property (laxyuup), which ties them to their ancestral territories. The community combines traditional governance with modern administrative functions, reflecting their resilience and commitment to preserving their heritage (Kitsumkalum Band n.d.). The Kitsumkalum River salmon populations have been an important part of their culture and economy (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). 2.4 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.1 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figure 2.2). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figure 2.2). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (Calvin et al. 2023; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EE003&quot;, start_year = 1980) sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EE004&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). 2.5 Morice River The Morice River watershed drains 4,379km2 of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Canada 2024). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figure 2.3). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED002&quot;) sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED003&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only). Right: Hydrograph for Morice River near outlet of Morice Lake (Station #08ED002). 2.6 Zymoetz River The Zymoetz River (known locally as the Copper River) watershed is an eighth order stream that drains an area of 3026km2 in a generally westerly direction. It is considered a major tributary of the Skeena River, as it contributes approximately 10% of the flow. The headwater lakes are located approximately 20km southwest of Smithers, and they include Aldrich, Dennis and McDonell Lakes. The upper and lower portions of the watershed are accessed via logging roads off of Highway 16 from Smithers and Terrace, respectively. Access to the middle watershed is difficult due to road wash out. The Zymoetz River flows roughly 120km, starting just west of Hudson Bay mountain near Smithers and ending at the confluence of the Skeena River, approximately 8km north-east of Terrace. Elevations in the watershed range from 120m at the confluence, to 2740m in the Howson Range. The Duthie mine operated on the south-west slope of Hudson Bay Mountain during the 1930’s and 1950’s, and reports have documented contaminated streams and lakes in the surrounding area (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The lower end of the Zymoetz watershed has seen a significant reduction in riparian habitat due to fires, forest development practices, pipe line and road construction (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). Snowmelt plays a big role in controlling the stream hydrology, with a mean annual discharge estimated at 106 m3/s at station 08EF005 located near Smithers. Peak discharge happens in May to early June, which is typical of a high elevation watershed like this (Figure 2.4). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EF005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EF005.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Zymoetz River Above O.k. Creek (Station #08EF005 - Lat 54.49363 Lon -128.32466). Available mean daily discharge data from 1963 to 2021. 2.6.1 Kispiox River The Kispiox River watershed is a seventh order stream that drains an area of 2100km2 in a south east direction. It is a large tributary of the Skeena River, contributing approximately 9% of its flow. It flows 140km to the confluence of the Skeena River, near Kispiox Village. Elevations in the watershed range from 200m at the mouth to as high as 2090m on Kispiox Mountain. The mainstream of the Kispiox is fed mainly by glacier melt and high elevation snow melt. Swan and Stephens Lakes (located in the upper watershed) are important sockeye systems. Swan Lake drains via Club Lake into Stephens Lake which in turn flows via Stephens Creek into the mainstem of the Kispiox River. Some of the biggest threats to aquatic ecosystems in the Kispiox valley are reported as erosion, obstructions, sedimentation, and altered water yield. The upper third of the Kispiox watershed (upstream of the Nangeese River) is well protected from development by the Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park and because it contains few roads with little forestry development (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Kispiox River has a mean annual discharge estimated at 45 m3/s at station 08EB004 located near Hazelton. Peak discharge happens in May and June as a result of the spring snowmelt (Figure 2.5). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EB004&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EB004.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Kispiox River Near Hazelton (Station #08EB004 - Lat 55.43385 Lon -127.71616). Available mean daily discharge data from 1963 to 2022. 2.7 Kitsumkalum River The Kitsumkalum River is a sixth order stream that flows east from the Coast Mountains to Kitsumkalum lake then south to Terrace where it joins the Skeena River, draining an area of 2289km2. Major tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River include the Cedar River, Nelson River, Mayo Creek, Goat Creek, Lean-To Creek and Deep Creek (McElhanney 2022). Peak flows occur in May-June from snow melt with subsequent peaks the fall from rain events (McElhanney 2022). There is one hydrometric station below Kitsumkalum lake which has been active since 2018, and has a mean annual discharge of 126 m3/s (Figure 2.6). From 1929-1954, there was a hydrometric station near Terrace, which estimated the mean annual discharge to be 138m3/s. The Kitsumkalum River watershed has been highly impacted by logging. Many of the tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River have altered channel morphology, increased bedload movement, bank failures, sediment loading, and debris accumulation (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). There has been a significant amount of work done to enhance salmon populations within the watershed. The SkeenaWild Conservation Trust is conducting riparian restoration surveys on several tributaries to the Kitsumkalum River, including Willow Creek, Spring Creek, Lean-To Creek, and Deep Creek (Healthy Watersheds Initiative 2021). The Deep Creek Hatchery, operated by the Terrace Salmonid Enhancement Society, has been supporting Kitsumkalum River chinook populations since 1984 (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). Additionally, there is a small groundwater facility for the incubation and rearing coho and chum, run by the Kitsumkalum First Nation (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). In 2000 The Clear Creek Eastern Side Channel was constructed to enhance juvenile rearing habitat and adult spawning habitat for coho salmon on Clear Creek, a tributary to the Kitsumkalum River, however the site has not been maintained and beaver activity has obstructed fish accessibility to much of the channel (Elmer 2021). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08EG019&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EG019.png&quot;) Figure 2.6: Kitsumkalum River Below Alice Creek (Station #08EG019 - Lat 54.6793 Lon -128.74396). Available mean daily discharge data from 2018 to 2022. 2.8 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). 2.8.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in the greater Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007); pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report sourceing information from Department of Fisheries and Oceans (1991) that principal spawning areas for chinook in the Neexdzii Kwah include the mainstem above and below Buck and McQuarrie Creeks, between Cesford and Watson Creeks, and the reaches upstream and downstream of Bulkley Falls. Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Neexdzii Kwah is considered Class II water and there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.8.1.1 Upper Bulkley Falls A detailed field assessment and write up regarding the upper Bulkley falls was conducted as part of fish passage restoration in the watershed - is presented in Irvine (2021) with a condensed summary here. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, the channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm (Irvine 2021). Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Neexdzii Kwah from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported that approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Neexdzii Kwah, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) also reported that coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972. dfo_sad_raw %&gt;% ldfo_sad_plot_line(&quot;BULKLEY RIVER - UPPER&quot;, &quot;total_return_to_river&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;analysis_yr&quot;, col_group_exclude = &quot;Coho&quot;) dfo_sad_raw %&gt;% ldfo_sad_plot_line(&quot;BULKLEY RIVER - UPPER&quot;, &quot;natural_adult_spawners&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;analysis_yr&quot;, col_group_exclude = &quot;Coho&quot;) 2.8.2 Morice River Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in Bustard and Schell (2002), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002), Schell (2003), A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), and ILMB (2007) with a comprehensive review of water quality by Oliver (2018) Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead. 2.8.3 Zymoetz River Within the Zymoetz Watershed, there are many areas with high fishery values. Steelhead are the most extensively documented fish species in the Zymoetz River watershed. Adults enter the river from July to November and then go on to spawn the following year in late spring to early summer. The Zymoetz River is a relatively steep system. Two canyons are located 6.4 and 19.6 kilometers upstream of the Skeena River confluence. These canyons make access to the Zymoetz difficult for pink and chum salmon (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Zymoetz River is renowned for its aggressive steelhead that have been known to take flies or lures. There is a 50km stretch upstream of Limonite Creek that’s very remote and offers high quality fishing opportunities for anglers (FLNRORD 2013). Traditional First Nations use of the upper Zymoetz River watershed by the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people differed between community sites, residences, and fish houses, and was large and diverse. From the upper to lower Zymoetz River and to the Skeena River, a significant ancient grease trail connected, with a branch track forking through Limonite Creek and flowing down the Telkwa River. The fishery used a weir at the mouth of McDonell Lake and spears at Six Mile Flats, near Dennis Lake. There is no information on native fisheries on the lower Zymoetz River. The Zymoetz is considered to be one of the top ten steelhead rivers in BC (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.8.4 Kispiox River Kispiox River salmon are a important food source and cultural symbol for the Gitxsan people with sockeye and coho historically the two most significant species. Gitangwalk and Lax Didax, two significant villages that were both abandoned in the early 1900s, were situated on the Kispiox in such a way as to block the sockeye and coho salmon’s upstream migration to the Upper Kispiox River spawning grounds providing opportunities to gather and preserve a significant amount of high-quality food over relatively short time periods (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The 100 km of mainstem and 300km of tributary streams in the Kispiox River Watershed are considering high value fish habitat supporting migration, spawning and rearing for many fish species. The Kispiox fisheries supports both recreational and commercial fishing while also enhancing the ecology, nutrient regime, and structural diversity of the drainage. Since 1992, sockeye and coho escapements from the Kispiox Watershed have been documented by the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities as they creates strong cultural, economic, and symbolic ties for the local communities (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.8.5 Kitsumkalum River The Kitsumkalum River is an important waterway for all species of salmon. It is one of the three main chinook producing rivers in the Skeena watershed and supports all five species of pacific salmon, steelhead, and other resident trout and char species (McElhanney 2022). Most notably, the Kitsumkalum River has consistently produced the largest-bodied chinook in the Skeena Watershed, as well as on most of the Pacific coast (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). The watershed supports strong recreational coho, steelhead, and chinook fishing. Kitsumkalum salmon also play an important role in the culture and economy of the Kitsumkalum Band (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). 2.8.6 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data was accessed via the NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System through the Open Government Portal. A brief memo on the data extraction process is available here. 2.8.7 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Morice, Bulkley, Zymoetz, Kispiox, and Kitsumkalum Rivers watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2019a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.7. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 : # # - Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment -- Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. # - Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation -- Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. # - Phase 3: Design -- Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. # - Phase 4: Remediation -- Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% dplyr::filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;BULK&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` ### Bulkley River # There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system.

No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISHabitat]. Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek [@moe2021PSCISRemediation]. McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm. Kathryn Graham, Regional Manager Environmental Services - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure). # # ## Morice river # # Within the Morice River watershed group prior to 2021, 21 fish passage assessments (Phase 1) had been recorded in the PSCIS database [@moe2021PSCISAssessments]. At the time of reporting, no habitat confirmations had been recorded [@moe2021PSCISHabitat]. Two culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS in the and include works on a tributary to the Morice River located at km 39.2 of the Morice River FSR and on bridge installation at km 4 of McBride Road on a tributary to McBride Lake [@moe2021PSCISRemediation]. ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% dplyr::filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;MORR&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Communicate Connectivity Issues 3.2 Planning 3.3 Fish Passage Assessments 3.4 Designs 3.5 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.6 Fish Sampling 3.7 Remediations 3.8 Climate Change Risk Assessment", " 3 Methods fish_col_permit_num &lt;- &quot;SM24-882238&quot; 3.1 Communicate Connectivity Issues 3.1.1 Engage Partners Engaging partners for ecosystem restoration initiatives is critical as it allows us to utilize available resources, tap into different areas of expertise, and benefit from diverse perspectives through collaboration that leads to successful outcomes. Engagement actions have included video conference calls, meetings, emails, presentations and phone calls. 3.1.2 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions, it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities, a collaborative GIS environment has been established using QGIS and is served on the cloud using source code stored here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access, view, and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared, up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as on phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time, helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about the scripts used for GIS project creation and updates can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: Download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalogue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. 3.1.3 Issue Tracking “Issues” logged on the online github platform are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs related to project components. They can be referenced with the scripts, text and actions used to address them by linking documentation to the issues with text comments or programatically through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here. 3.1.4 Mapping The workflows to produce the georeferenced pdf maps include using a QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required and are continuously evolving. At the time of reporting - mapping scripts and associated layer file were kept under version control within bcfishpass here. Loading the QGIS layer file within a QGIS project, allows load and representation of all map component layers provided the user points to a postgresql database populated via bcfishpass outputs. 3.2 Planning 3.2.1 Habitat Modelling Habitat modelling used to help guide planning for field assessments is generated by bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2024) which has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation by generating a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. bcfishpass documentation (including known limitations) is located here. The model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classify the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris [2020] 2021). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with numerous parameters including known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, and an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams). Furthermore, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area, stream discharge, and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This information can be used to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored, by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. Regarding gradients, bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this phase of the project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that rainbow trout (20%) and bull trout (25%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering, and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 20% and 25% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2019b) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, or multiple FISS channel widths are available a mean of the average channel widths was used. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were downloaded to a postgresql database, sampled for upstream watershed areas associated with each stream segment and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. In early 2021, Bayesian statistical methods were developed to predict channel width in all provincial freshwater atlas stream segments where width measurements had not previously been measured in the field. The model was based on the relationship between watershed area and mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area (Thorley and Irvine 2021). In December of 2021, Thorley and Irvine (2021) methods were updated using a power model derived by Finnegan et al. (2005) which relates stream discharge to watershed area and mean annual precipitation. Data (n = 24849) on watershed size, mean annual precipitation and measured channel width was extracted from the provincial freshwater atlas (FLNRORD 2021; GeoBC 2022), the BC Data Catalogue fisheries datasets (MoE 2024c, 2021) and Wang et al. (2012) utilizing bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2021) and fwapg (Norris [2019] 2021). Details of this analysis and subsequent outputs can be reviewed here (Thorley, Norris, and Irvine 2021). bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2019b). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Parsnip River watershed group have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest potential intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Definitions of modelling outputs for bull trout are presented in Table 3.3. Modelling of habitat for Arctic grayling, in the Peace region are planned for 2024-2025 with the work leveraging multiple other initiatives underway by SERNbc and others throughout British Columbia including work related to Arctic grayling habitat use and preference conducted by UNBC and others [Hagen and Stamford (2023); Bottoms et al.

The reader is referred to (BC Ministry of Environment 2011) for detailed methodology. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, road fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.5). fpr_table_habvalue |&gt; knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.5: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per BC Ministry of Environment (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Tables 3.6 - 3.7). These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data, a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::select(V4, everything()) |&gt; janitor::row_to_names(1) |&gt; ##turn the table sideways dplyr::mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.6: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.6), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (8.5%) was used. To generate estimates for area of habitat upstream (m2), the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. 3.3.1 Cost Estimates Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to help refine estimates which have since been adjusted for inflation in 2020 and based on past experience. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $30000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 15m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $100k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page then adjusted for inflation in 2020). For larger streams (&gt;6m), estimated span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream. For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 15 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.8) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. sfpr_xref_road_cost() |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_m_1000s_bridge = formatC(cost_m_1000s_bridge * 15000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_embed_cv = formatC(cost_embed_cv * 1000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::rename( Class = my_road_class, Surface = my_road_surface, `Class Multiplier` = road_class_mult, `Surface Multiplier` = road_surface_mult, `Bridge $/15m` = cost_m_1000s_bridge, `Streambed Simulation $` = cost_embed_cv ) |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(Class)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(Class = dplyr::case_when( Class == &#39;fsr&#39; ~ stringr::str_to_upper(Class), TRUE ~ stringr::str_to_title(Class)), Surface = stringr::str_to_title(Surface) ) |&gt; # filter(Class != &#39;FSR&#39; &amp; Surface != &#39;Paved&#39;) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.8: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Completed designs are loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.5 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.5). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to a minimum distance 300m and upstream to a minimum distance of 500 - 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.6 Fish Sampling 3.6.1 Electrofishing Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual (Resources Inventory Committee 2001). A Haltech 2000 backpack electrofisher was used within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings and seconds, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start and end locations, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. 3.6.2 Fish Handling and Processing Captured fish were held in buckets with sufficient water to minimize stress until processing, and multiple buckets were used when catch numbers were high. For each fish captured, fork length, weight and species was recorded with results documented in the fish data submission spreadsheet. 3.6.3 Pit Tagging Fish with a fork length greater than 60 mm and belonging to species approved under the scientific fish collection permit SM24-882238 were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) using the Abdominal Cavity method outlined by Biomark. To anesthetize fish prior to pit tagging, we used a solution of approximately 0.1 mL of clove oil per 1 L of water (1:10,000). This concentration was selected for its efficiency in providing effective sedation with minimal residual effects, making it ideal for studies in which fish are released back into their natural habitats (Fernandes et al. 2017). The clove oil solution was prepared in advance by dissolving pure clove oil in ethyl alcohol in a 1:9 ratio (clove oil: ethyl alcohol) to enhance solubility, then mixed into the water bucket (Fernandes et al. 2017). Fish were immersed in this solution until they reached an appropriate level of anesthesia for handling and then were tagged. To maintain needle sharpness and minimize injury risk, needles were replaced approximately every 10 fish. Each tagged fish was scanned with the PIT reader, and both the PIT tag ID and row ID were recorded. Once tagged, fish were placed into a bucket of fresh water and allowed to recover before being released back into the stream. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit SM24-882238. 3.7 Remediations Structure replacement was conducted by contractors hired by Sinclar (forest licensee). As-built drawings were completed and loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.8 Climate Change Risk Assessment In collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTi), a new climate change replacement program aims to prioritize vulnerable culverts for replacement (pers. comm Sean Wong, 2022) based on data collected and ranked related to three categories - culvert condition, vulnerability and priority. Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.9).

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_human_cultural_economic.hist_hist_trails_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/98c097cf-32bc-40a6-8061-bfe97a295e37 This dataset contains spatial and tabular data on non-archaeological historic trails in B.C.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number.

The falls have not yet been documented in the FISS database (MoE 2024b) but have been previously noted in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), the World Waterfall Database (“Buck Falls, British Columbia, Canada - World Waterfall Database” n.d.), and on the Houston Hikers website (“Buck Falls | Adventures” n.d.). Although rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, kokannee and other non-salmonid resident species have been documented upstream of the falls in the FISS database - no salmon species are documented upstream (MoE 2024a). An assessment was conducted on September 19, 2024 to assess the feasibility of upstream migration of the falls. The falls consist of a series of three separate vertical and cascade sections over and approximately 200m section of stream. The upper falls consisted of a ~4 m high vertical drop, presenting a substantial barrier to fish passage (Figure 4.2). Approximately 25 m downstream, the second falls was a ~3.5 m high sheer drop to bedrock, with minimal pool depth available to facilitate fish passage (Figure 4.3). Further downstream ~100 m, the third step comprised a ~1.5 m vertical drop with an overlying cascade, exhibiting a ~15% gradient over a 1.0 m height (Figure 4.4).

A total of 16 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 9 Phase 1 assessments and 7 reassessments. In 2024, field efforts prioritized revisiting previously assessed sites for monitoring rather than evaluating new Fish Passage Assessment locations. As this was the fifth year of the study, a substantial number of sites had already been assessed, allowing the focus to shift toward monitoring and informing restoration activities at key locations. Of the 16 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 9 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 4 crossings considered “passable”, 1 crossings considered a “potential” barrier, and 4 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). Reassessments were completed at 7 sites where PSICS data required updating. A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.4. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 |&gt; select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments.

A total of approximately 6 km of stream was assessed. Electrofishing surveys were conducted at all habitat confirmation sites. Georeferenced field maps are provided in Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.5 - 4.7 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format here. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure 4.6. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document. table_phase2_overview &lt;- function(dat, caption_text = &#39;&#39;, font = font_set, scroll = TRUE){ dat2 &lt;- dat |&gt; kable(caption = caption_text, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(11), width_min = &#39;4in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(1:10), width_max = &#39;1in&#39;) if(identical(scroll,TRUE)){ dat2 &lt;- dat2 |&gt; kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, height = &quot;500px&quot;) } dat2 } tab_overview |&gt; table_phase2_overview(caption_text = &#39;Overview of habitat confirmation sites.

The stream exhibited medium-value habitat with a good flow and abundant gravels throughout. A mature mixed forest, including cottonwood, provided excellent bank stabilization, resulting in deeply undercut banks and intermittent pools up to 60 cm deep within the surveyed area. Electrofishing conducted downstream of the crossing captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and Dolly Varden. Upstream sampling captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids. The low-gradient habitat is suitable for cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and coho juvenile rearing, as well as adfluvial and anadromous spawning. A sizeable beaver dam complex was present at the upper end of the surveyed area, coinciding with the confluence of a tributary mapped in the Freshwater Atlas. There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current mapping may misrepresent the watershed’s size. This remains unconfirmed, but LiDAR analysis could be used to verify these connections. POINT (941434.1 1035299) 198940 Tributary to Knapper Creek HM7504 Canfor R07549 16 636706 6020960 9 CT;RB 1.2 Medium high The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR, down to this crossing on road/spur HM7504, approximately 340 m. This section of stream provided medium-value habitat, with good flow, abundant gravels for spawning, and suitable rearing areas within undercut banks and occasional deep pools. Evidence of historic beaver activity is present throughout the area surveyed, including one large breached dam near the upstream end of the site. The riparian zone consists of a healthy shrub and herbaceous flood-tolerant plant community. The stream corridor is approximately 40–50 m wide, bordered by mature coniferous forest on both sides. Electrofishing conducted at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and Dolly Varden. POINT (941708 1035493) 58245 Simpson Creek Lake Kathlyn Road MoTi 615383 6075125 9 CO;CT;DV;MW;OS;RB;SA;ST 1.6 High low The stream was surveyed from the railway downstream to Lake Kathlyn Road, covering approximately 1 km. The upper 750 m of the stream is in relatively good condition, with mostly intact riparian vegetation, abundant gravels, deep pools, and large woody debris throughout. The lower 250–500 m is heavily impacted by adjacent private lands, with riparian vegetation removal, stream channelization, and bank armouring. Extensive beaver activity was observed within the lower ~300 m, with dams ranging from 0.4 to 1 m in height. An additional crossing was noted on private land just upstream of Lake Kathlyn Road on a driveway. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. POINT (922761.7 1090677) 198916 Gershwin Creek Railway CN Rail 580463 6115769 9 CT;DV 0.0 Medium high This survey covers the area from the railway culvert (crossing 198916, ~100m long and from the 1920s) upstream to the crossing on Highway 16 (crossing 198913), spanning approximately 900 m. A separate habitat confirmation was conducted upstream of Highway 16. Therefore, this site encompasses both 198916_us and 198913_ds. A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250 m upstream of the culvert, creating a 17% gradient over a 9 m section due to a fallen tree. The stream had good flow in this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. Occasional pockets of gravels suitable for coho, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout spawning were present. Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing. WP79 markes the confluence with a steel bridge on private land. POINT (889690.4 1132894) 198913 Gershwin Creek Highway 16 MOTi 581250 6115660 9 CT;DV 0.0 Medium mod The stream has frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravel present despite a significant amount of fines. It has a low gradient near the culvert and flows through agricultural fields, but maintains sufficient riparian cover with large cottonwoods throughout the 600 m survey. A landowner-constructed bridge with two culverts is located ~250 m upstream of the highway crossing. Two ~1 m high logjams are present but remain passable for fish. Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing. POINT (890471 1132751) 58264 Simpson Creek Nielson Road MoTi 614280 6074951 9 – – High high The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road upstream for approximately 650 m, to roughly 200 m upstream of the powerlines. The stream had a steeper gradient with predominantly boulder cover and pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning. Pools were infrequent. The upper end of the site was located just upstream of a short cascade with a 20% gradient. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy, mature mixed forest. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat, particularly below Nielsen Road, as this is a known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. The culvert on Nielsen Road has a significant outlet drop and likely limits fish passage. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road.

The stream likely contains numerous pools during higher flows but had very low flows at the time of assessment. Flowing through agricultural land on both sides, the stream is heavily eroded downstream, making it a strong candidate for fencing and riparian management. Upstream habitat was less eroded and consisted of mature riparian vegetation providing good habitat for fish. Only two fish were captured during sampling (both in the deep outlet pool), which was unexpected given the good habitat. Conductivity was extremely high, possibly due to upstream cattle activity and surrounding land use.

This stream flows from an unnamed lake, first southwest and then northwest, before entering the Skeena River approximately 12.5km southwest of the town of New Hazelton. PSCIS crossing 198916 is located 1.8km upstream of the confluence of Gershwin Creek and the Skeena River, on the CN Railway. Approximately 900m upstream, crossing 198913 is located on Highway 16. Both crossings are within the Kispiox River watershed group. Background Gershwin Creek is a fourth order stream with an upstream watershed area of approximately 12.9km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2019m to 264m near the lower crossing (Table 4.10). In 2023, crossings 198916 and 198913 were assessed with fish passage assessments (Irvine and Schick 2023). These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream and fish documented immediately downstream of the Highway 16 crossing during the 2023 assessment (Irvine and Schick 2023). Previously, have been documented in the lake upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (198913) (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024a). During the 2024 survey, two additional crossings were assessed. Approximately 1.3km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (198913) on Gershwin Creek, a crossing was assessed on Comeau Road (PSCIS crossing 203123). At this location, the stream had no visible channel and was determined to be unlikely to provide fish habitat. Approximately 680 m upstream of the railway crossing, a small tributary flows into Gershwin Creek from the north. In 2023, PSCIS crossing 198907 was assessed where this tributary intersects Braucher Road. At this location, the stream had moderate flow downstream with a well-defined channel, while the upstream channel was heavily overgrown and led to a wetland. In 2024, a second crossing on this tributary was assessed approximately 900 m further upstream on Comeau Road (PSCIS crossing 203124). Downstream of this crossing, the stream was described as a very small drainage. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.10: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 198916.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 198916 and 198913 At the time of assessment, PSCIS crossing 198916 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.12). Constructed in the 1920s, this crossing is a concrete box culvert approximately 100 m in length, located beneath the CN railway with approximately 30–40 m of fill above it. It features a moderate 0.45 m outlet drop that adult fish could likely overcome but is presumed to act as a barrier to juvenile fish. The culvert’s relatively steep 6% slope, minimal flow depths, and swift currents further impede fish passage. Installing baffles within the culvert would likely improve fish passage conditions. PSCIS crossing 198913 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.13). Located on Highway 16, this crossing had a 0.35 m outlet drop and a significant 0.85 m deep outlet pool, suggesting the culvert is undersized for the stream. At both crossings, the water temperature was 7.6\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.1 and conductivity was 305 uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 4.12: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198916.

Comments: The concrete box culvert is approximately 100 m long beneath a railway crossing, with about 30 to 40 m of fill above it. A swift current flows through the culvert, and installing baffles could improve fish passage. Fish sampling captured cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden. There is a moderate outlet drop, but adult fish could likely move upstream. The habitat upstream features good flow through a steeper section with a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest, stable banks, and gravel pockets suitable for spawning coho, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Downstream, abundant boulders create step pools alongside frequent large woody debris, though high flows limited suitable fish habitat during the survey.

Comments: There is a deep outlet pool, suggesting the culvert is undersized for the stream. High-quality gravels were present at the pool‚Äôs outlet, and upstream of the crossing, there was high-value habitat with frequent overwintering pools, spawning gravels, and adequate riparian cover with large cottonwoods throughout. This site was part of a habitat confirmation assessment, with the stream surveyed from the downstream railway crossing up to this location and an additional 600 m upstream. Downstream, crossing 198916 consists of a large, long box culvert beneath the railway with minimal flow depth and a swift current, making it unlikely that fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River can access this site until the railway barrier is addressed. Fish sampling at this site captured cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden.

The stream contained numerous boulders forming step pools; however, moderate flows at the time of assessment limited the availability of pools suitable for fish. The first pool suitable for overwintering fish, with adequately reduced flow, was located approximately 250 m downstream of the culvert. There were occasional gravels suitable for spawning and frequent large woody debris, which contributed to the formation of additional steps. (Figure 4.10). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 5.9m, the average wetted width was 3.7m, and the average gradient was 5.1%. The habitat was rated as medium value suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 198916 and Downstream of Crossing 198913 The stream was surveyed from the railway crossing (198916) upstream to the Highway 16 crossing (198913), a distance of approximately 900 m (Figures 4.11 - 4.12. A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250 m upstream of the railway crossing, creating a 17% gradient over a 9 m section due to a fallen tree. The stream maintained good flow through this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4.4m, the average wetted width was 3.3m, and the average gradient was 4.4%. The habitat was rated as medium value and contained occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning by coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 198913 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198913 for 600m . The stream had frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravels present despite a significant amount of fines. In the ~200 m section just upstream of the crossing, the stream maintains a low gradient and flows through agricultural fields, however, there were large cottonwoods providing sufficient riparian cover observed throughout the entire 600 m surveyed. Two logjams, each approximately 1 m in height, were observed but remain passable for fish (Figure 4.13).The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 6.0m, the average wetted width was 4m, and the average gradient was 2.8%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing an spawning. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted below and above the railway crossing (198916) with results summarised in Tables 4.15 - 4.17 and Figure 4.8. A total of 35 fish were captured downstream including Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, and 3 Dolly Varden were captured upstream (Figure 4.14). . Electrofishing was also conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing on Highway 16 (198913) with results summarised in Tables 4.16 - 4.18 and Figure 4.9. A total of 12 fish were captured downstream including Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, and 9 Dolly Varden were captured upstream (Figure 4.15). . Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the railway crossing (198916) with a bridge or open bottom structure is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 26,625,000. It is unlikely that fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River can access Gershwin Creek upstream of this railway crossing, and although construction would be expensive and challenging, this crossing is a high priority for restoration follow-up. Until the downstream railway crossing is upgraded, replacement of the upstream crossing on Highway 16 (198913) is not recommended. If the downstream crossing is upgraded, the Highway 16 crossing should be replaced with a bridge spanning 15 m. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 11,250,000. Conclusion PSCIS crossings 198916 and 198913 are located on Gershwin Creek which provides medium to high-value habitat for salmonids, including coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Conservative estimates indicate approximately 2.3km of coho rearing habitat upstream of the railway crossing and 1.3km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing. Crossing 198916 on the CN Railway is a historic, exceptionally long concrete box culvert with approximately 30–40 m of fill above it. It has been identified as a barrier to juvenile fish passage due to its 0.45 m outlet drop, steep slope, and swift currents. This culvert likely inhibits fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River from accessing upstream habitats beyond this crossing. The site was rated as a high priority for replacement, however, given the significant cost and scale of such a project, the installation of baffles is recommended as a more practical interim solution to improve fish passage conditions. Replacement of the upstream Highway 16 crossing (198913) is recommended only if the downstream CN Railway crossing is first upgraded, as fish passage is otherwise restricted at the railway culvert. Collectively, these crossings form a passage for salmonid movement within the watershed. Restoration efforts should prioritize the downstream CN Railway crossing, as its improvement would unlock access to high-value rearing and spawning habitats further upstream. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 4.14: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 198916 and 198913.

Tributary to Knapper Creek flows into Knapper Creek, which joins the Morice River approximalety 2km downstream. PSCIS crossing 198940 is located 1.3km upstream of the confluence of the subject tributary and Knapper Creek, on spur HM7504. Approximately 350 m upstream, crossing 198935 is located on Gold creek fsr. Both crossings are within the Morice River watershed group. Background At this location, Tributary to Knapper Creek is a second order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 4.1km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1131m to 785m near the lower crossing (Table 4.19). There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current estimates may under-represent the watershed’s size. In 2023, crossings 198940 and 198935 were assessed with fish passage assessments (Irvine and Schick 2023). These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream and fish observed during the 2023 assessment (Irvine and Schick 2023). Previously, cutthroat trout and rainbow trout have been documented upstream of crossing 198940 (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024a). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.19: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 198940.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 198940 and 198935 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 198940 on spur HM7504 was un-embedded, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.21). However, the culvert was backwatered to 30%, making it unlikely to be a barrier to fish passage. The pipe was significantly undersized for the stream, and the road appeared to be failing, likely due to a partially clogged inlet and spring freshet impacts. PSCIS crossing 198935 on Gold creek fsr was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.22). This culvert had a significant 0.8 m deep outlet pool, and was deteriorating at the inlet. At all crossings, the water temperature was 4.9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 236 uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 4.21: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198940.

The habitat was rated as medium, with good flow, abundant gravels, overhanging banks, and healthy riparian vegetation, providing good rearing and spawning habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.3m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 3.3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 198940 and Downstream of Crossing 198935 The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR (198935), down to the crossing on road/spur HM7504 (198940), a distance of approximately 340 m (Figure 4.18). The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 1.2m, and the average gradient was 2.7%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The habitat was rated as medium value with good flow, abundant spawning gravels, and suitable rearing habitat in undercut banks and occasional deep pools. Historic beaver activity was evident, including a large breached dam near the upstream end of the site. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy shrub and herbaceous flood-tolerant plant community. The stream corridor, approximately 40–50 m wide, was bordered by mature coniferous forest on both sides. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 198935 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198935 for 700m . (Figure 4.19). The habitat was rated as medium value with a good flow and abundant gravels throughout. A mature mixed forest, including cottonwood, provided excellent bank stabilization, resulting in deeply undercut banks and intermittent pools up to 60 cm deep within the surveyed area. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 2.2%. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of crossing (198935) with results summarised in Tables 4.24 - 4.25 and Figure 4.16. A total of 39 fish were captured downstream including rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and Dolly Varden. Upstream of the crossing 43 fish were captured including rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrid (Figure 4.20). . # FOR THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS TO RUN WE NEED: # - `tab_cost_est_phase2` build in `tables.R` which is used by `fpr_my_cost_estimate()` Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Gold Creek FSR crossing (198935) with a bridge (18 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 450,000. At the time of assessment, the downstream crossing on road/spur HM7504 was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR. However, should restoration activities proceed at crossing 198940, replacement with a bridge spanning 15 m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 540,000. Conclusion Tributary to Knapper Creek contains moderate-value rearing and spawning habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Electrofishing at the time of assessment confirmed the presence of rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, cutthroat/rainbow trout hybrids, and Dolly Varden. Habitat modelling identified 1.2km of steelhead rearing habitat upstream of crossing 198940, with approximately 300m less upstream of 198935. There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current modelling may under-represent the watershed’s size. Should restoration activities proceed, efforts should focus on PSCIS crossingr as.character(my_site2) on Gold Creek FSR, which had a small outlet drop and a deep outlet pool. PSCIS crossing 198940 on Road/Spur HM7504 was backwatered and not presumed to be a barrier to fish passage.

The stream is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, and is located south of the mapped channel. Simpson Creek flows into Kathlyn Creek, which joins the Bulkley River approximalety 4km downstream. PSCIS crossing 58245 is located 70m upstream of the confluence of Simpson Creek and Kathlyn Creek, on Lake Kathlyn Road. Approximately 1.4km upstream, crossing 58264 is located on Nielson Road. Both crossings are within the Bulkley River watershed group. Background At this location, Simpson Creek is a third order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 13.1km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2477m to 503m near the lower crossing (Table 4.26). Simpson Creek is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the 2024 assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. In 2012, PSCIS crossings 58245 and 58264 were assessed with fish passage assessments by Marlim Ecological Consulting Ltd. and both were ranked as barriers (MarLim Ecological Consulting Ltd. 2013). Historically, Simpson Creek has been a spawning location for coho salmon. Since 1986, coho have been transplanted into the Kathlyn Creek system from the Toboggan Creek Hatchery (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). Kathlyn Creek also supports a small population of pink salmon, and steelhead are known to inhabit Kathlyn Lake and spawn upstream of the Chicken Creek confluence, which would include areas near the Simpson Creek confluence (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). Adjacent to the crossing on Nielson Road (58264), coho salmon and other salmonids have been documented in the past, along with cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, steelhead, mountain whitefish, and Dolly Varden (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024a). Approximately 360 m downstream of Nielson Road, the adjacent landowner has observed recent steelhead and coho spawning and historically chinook spawning. According to the a nearby landowner, the crossing on Nielson Road (58264) was originally a bridge but was replaced with the current culvert during an emergency flood event in the 1990s. Upstream of the crossing on Nielson Road, a trail runs parallel to the stream for 400m up to the power line, offering an excellent opportunity for community engagement. By connecting people to the land, the trail can foster stewardship and advocacy for the stream, which may lead to future restoration efforts. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.26: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 58245.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 58245 and 58264 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 58245 on Lake Kathlyn Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and although it ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol, neither of the two culverts at this location had an outlet drop, therefore it is unlikely a barrier to fish passage (MoE 2011) (Table 4.28). PSCIS crossing 58264 on Nielson Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.29). This concrete oval culvert had a significant 1 m outlet drop and 1.2 m deep outlet pool. A third crossing was assessed where Simpson Creek crosses the CN railway, approximately 530 m upstream of the crossing on Lake Kathlyn Road (58245). At this location there are two culverts roughly 30 m apart, the southern pipe was dry and fully embedded, while the northern pipe was currently conveying the main flow of Simpson Creek. At all crossings, the water temperature was 6.1\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.7 and conductivity was 107 uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 4.28: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 58245.

Comments: This concrete oval culvert has a significant 1 m outlet drop, likely inhibiting fish passage. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, located south of the mapped channel. Upstream habitat includes boulder cover, gravel pockets suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning, and a healthy mature mixed forest riparian zone. Downstream habitat transitions to lower-gradient, high-value conditions with extensive gravels, deep pools (up to 90 cm), large woody debris, and abundant cover, supporting recent steelhead and historically chinook spawning, as reported by the adjacent landowner. Habitat confirmations were completed at this site and all downstream crossings to the confluence with Kathlyn Creek. The stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. According to the landowner, this crossing was originally a bridge but was replaced with the current culvert during an emergency flood event in the 1990s. ##this is useful to get some comments for the report hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site2 &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing 58245 The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 58245 for 70m , to the confluence with Kathlyn Creek. The stream ran adjacent to the road along one bank, which had limited riparian vegetation consisting primarily of shrubs. The opposite bank, bordered by private property, had minimal vegetation and no significant riparian cover. Multiple sections of bank armouring and channelization were observed near the private property, and only small pockets of gravels suitable for spawning were observed (Figure 4.22). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was fines with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 6.2m, the average wetted width was 3.9m, and the average gradient was 2%. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 58245 and Downstream of Crossing 58264 The stream was surveyed from Nielson Road (crossing 58264) downstream to Lake Kathlyn Road (crossing 58245), a distance of approximately 1.4km (Figures 4.23 - 4.24). Downstream of Nielsen Road for approximately 300 m, the stream had steep gradients (5–6%) with straight riffle-cascade sections and confined, channelized, dyke-like banks. Beyond this section, and continuing to the railway crossing, the gradient decreased (2–3%), transitioning into high-quality habitat characterized by abundant gravels, deep pools up to 90 cm, large woody debris, and diverse cover. In this section of stream, the adjacent landowner reported recent steelhead and coho spawning, as well as historical chinook spawning. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 6.2m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 4.1%. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid spawning and rearing. Below the railway crossing, the stream consisted of mostly intact riparian vegetation, abundant gravels, deep pools, and large woody debris. Nearing Lake Kathlyn Road, the stream was heavily impacted by adjacent private lands, with riparian vegetation removed, the stream channelized, and banks armoured. Extensive beaver activity was observed in the lower stream, with dams ranging in height from 0.4 to 1 m. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 6m, the average wetted width was 4.3m, and the average gradient was 1.1%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid spawning and rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 58264 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 58264 for 615m . This section of the stream featured a steeper gradient, predominantly characterized by boulder cover with occasional pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning (Figure 4.25). Pools were infrequent throughout. The riparian zone was composed of a healthy, mature mixed forest, providing stability and shading. The upper end of the site was situated just upstream of a short cascade with a 20% gradient. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing an spawning. # &lt;!-- CURRENTLY NOT SHOWING GRADIENT ALTHOUGH IT IS PRESENT... --&gt; # `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = &#39;us&#39;)` Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of crossing (58264) with results summarised in Tables 4.31 - 4.32 and Figure 4.21. A total of 20 fish were captured downstream including rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrid, and Dolly Varden. Upstream of the crossing 12 rainbow trout were captured (Figure 4.26). . Electrofishing was conducted at one site approximately 360 m downstream of Nielsen Road, with results summarised in Tables 4.31 - 4.32 and Figure 4.21. At this location, the adjacent landowner had reported recent steelhead and coho spawning and historically Chinook spawning. A total of 43 fish were captured including coho salmon, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrid, and Dolly Varden (Figure 4.27). Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Nielson Road crossing (58264) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. The significant 1 m outlet drop at this crossing, combined with the presence of salmonids in the system, makes it a top priority for remediation. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 3,000,000. At the time of assessment, the downstream crossing on Lake Kathlyn Road was unlikely a barrier to fish passage. However, should restoration activities proceed, replacement with a bridge spanning 15 m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 3,000,000. Conclusion Simpson Creek is a significant contributor to the Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the 2024 assessment slightly less than those observed in the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid spawning and rearing. Simpson Creek has historically supported a variety of salmonids, and coho captured during electrofishing at the time of assessment further confirm the stream’s continued importance as salmonid habitat. PSCIS crossing 58264 on Nielsen Road is a strong candidate for remediation, given its large outlet drop (1m) and low traffic volume, it is a high priority for replacement. Upstream of this crossing, a trail runs alongside the stream offering opportunities for community engagement and education, which could foster stewardship and advocacy for the stream. PSCIS crossings 58245 on Lake Kathlyn Road is not presumed to be a significant barrier to fish passage and was rated as a low priority for replacement. However, the culverts were heavily corroded and located in an area impacted by riparian vegetation removal, stream channelization, and bank armouring, which presents a valuable opportunity for community-led restoration efforts and education. The proximity of these two sites to Smithers, BC, enhances the potential for public involvement and education, further supporting long-term restoration goals for Simpson Creek. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 4.30: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 58245 and 58264.

## Phase 1 - Fish Passage Assessemnts

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d, %Y")` by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Lucy Schick, B.Sc., Tieasha Pierre, Vern Joseph, Jesse Olson, and Jessica Doyon. A total of `r pscis_all |> filter(source != 'pscis_phase2.xlsm') |> nrow()` Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments and `r pscis_reassessments |> nrow()` reassessments. In 2024, field efforts prioritized revisiting previously assessed sites for monitoring rather than evaluating new Fish Passage Assessment locations. As this was the fifth year of the study, a substantial number of sites had already been assessed, allowing the focus to shift toward monitoring and informing restoration activities at key locations.

<br>

Of the `r pscis_all |> filter(source != 'pscis_phase2.xlsm') |> nrow()` sites where fish passage assessments were completed, `r pscis_phase1 |> nrow()` were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system.  This included `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') |> nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') |> nrow() |> english::as.english()` crossings considered a "potential" barrier, and `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') |> nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments].

<!-- Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Unknown') |> nrow() |> english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords and ranked as "unknown" according to the provincial protocol.  -->

<br>

Reassessments were completed at `r pscis_reassessments |> nrow()` sites where PSICS data required updating.

<br>

A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 2](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2024_reporting/appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html")`.


<br>

The "Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005; @bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013]. As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

```

## Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmation Assessments

During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at three sites within the Morice River, Kispiox River, and Bulkley River watershed groups. A total of approximately `r habitat_confirmations_priorities |> pull(length_surveyed) |> sum(na.rm = TRUE) |> round(-3)/1000` km of stream was assessed. Electrofishing surveys were conducted at all habitat confirmation sites. Georeferenced field maps are provided in Attachment 1.

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. 
Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}` Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls")`). A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

### Fish Sampling


Fish sampling was conducted at `r tab_fish_sites_sum |> n_distinct()` sites within `r tab_fish_sites_sum |> distinct(stream) |> nrow()` streams a total of `r tab_fish_summary |> dplyr::pull(count_fish) |> sum(na.rm = TRUE)` fish captured. At all electrofishing sitesm, salmonids with fork lengths >60mm were tagged with PIT tags to facitate the tracking of health and movement over time.  Fork length data was used to delineate salmonids based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (>65 to 110mm), juvenile (>110mm to 140mm) and adult (>140mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-histogram).  A summary of sites assessed are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-summary) and raw data is provided in [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all). Results are presented in greater detail within individual habitat confirmation site appendices.

## Phase 4 - Remediations

Remediation of fish passage has been completed at the following sites (listed by watershed group):

### Bulkley River 
- McDowell Creek - 58159 - Private Road.  Replaced with a clear-span bridge in 2022 with remediation work led by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. Background presented  [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/).
- Robert Hatch Creek - 197912 - Unnamed Road. Removal of the collapsed bridge in 2022 with remediation work led by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. Background presented  [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/).


### Kispiox River
- Tributary to Skeena River - 198217 - Sik-E-Dakh Water Tower Road.  Replacement of the crossing with a clear-span bridge in 2024
with remediation work led by the Gitskan Watershed Authorities. Background information - updated in 2024 - [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/)


## Monitoring

Ten sites where habitat confirmations were conducted in the past were revisited in 2023 to gather data to further inform prioritization and or to provide data for effectiveness monitoring. Below are sites visited (listed by watershed group) with details of data collected and links to reporting provided. 

### Bulkley River 

- Tributary to Buck Creek - PSCIS 197640 - Buck Flats Road.  Revisited with the intention to conduct fish sampling however the stream was primarily dry with water present only within a small culvert outlet pool. The culvert was reassessed for fish passage with results presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/).


- Helps Creek - PSCIS 124500 - Lawson Road. Electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time. Aerial imagery was also collected utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle.  Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/).

- Thompson Creek - PSCIS 123377 -  Walcott Road. Electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time. Aerial imagery was also collected utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle.  Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/).

- Gramophone Creek - PSCIS 58067 - Telkwa High Road. The site was revisited to scope for downstream barriers with the entire length of stream between Telkwa High Road and the Bulkley River surveyed.  A canyon was discovered approximately 600m from the Bulkley River and dip nettting was conducted below.  Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/).

### Morice River

All sites below have been incorporated
into the Bii Wenii Kwa Restoration/Recovery Plan lead by the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

- Riddeck Creek - PSCIS 197360 - Morice-Owen FSR. Electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time.  Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/). 

- Alvin Creek - PSCIS 197379 - Morice-Owen FSR (km 29.8). Revisited with the intention to conduct fish sampling however the stream was primarily dry with water present only within a small culvert outlet pool. Areas electrofished in 2022 were surveyed with PIT tag reader to scope for tags from potential mortalities related 
to the dewatering.  Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/). 

- Tributary to Owen Creek - PSCIS 197378 - Klate lake Road. Electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time. Aerial imagery was also collected utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle. Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/)


### Kispiox River

- Tributary to Skeena River - PSCIS 198217 - Sik-E-Dakh Water Tower Road.  Prior to replacement of the crosssing in the spring of 2024, electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked over time. Additionally, lidar imagery was also collected utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle.  Aerial imagery and lidar data were collected with a drone. Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/).

- Dale Creek - PSCIS 198215 - Kispiox Westside Road. Electrofishing was conducted above and below the crossing and fish over 60mm were tagged with PIT tags so that their movement and health can be tracked as part of effectiveness monitoring at the site. Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/).

- Sterritt creek - 198225 - Babine Slide FSR.  Revisited with the intention to conduct fish sampling however, before sampling was conducted surveyors observed a 2 - 3m high near vertical cascade flowing over bedrock into the small culvert outlet pool immediately below the FSR. It was decided to not proceed with electrofishing as replacement of the culvert with a bridge would not facilitate upstream fish migration. Results are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/).

## Planning

### Habitat Modelling
Habitat modelling from `bcfishpass` including access model, linear spawning/rearing habitat model and lateral habitat 
connectivity models for watershed groups within our study area were updated for the spring of 2025 and are included
spatially in the collaborative GIS project.  A snapshot of these outputs related to each modeled and PSCIS stream 
crossing structure are also included within an `sqlite` database within this year's project reporting/code repository [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2024_reporting/blob/main/data/bcfishpass.sqlite).


#### Statistical Support for `bcfishpass` Fish Habitat Modelling Updates
Initial mapping of stream discharge and temperature causal effects pathways for the future purpose of focusing aquatic restoration 
actions in areas of highest potential for positive impacts on fisheries values (ie. elimination of areas from intrinsic models 
where water temperatures are likely too cold to support fish production) are detailed in @hill_etal2024Spatialstream which is 
included as [Attachment 3](#attach-3-bayes). 


## Fish Passage Assessements

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_all$date), format="%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_all$date), format="%B %d, %Y")` by Al Irvine, R.P.Bio., Lucy Schick, B.Sc., Tieasha Pierre, Vern Joseph, Jesse Olson, and Jessica Doyon. 

### Natural Barriers to Fish Passage
An assessment of Buck falls was conducted on September 19, 2024 with results included in [Buck Falls - Appendix](#buck-falls).

### Road Stream Crossings

A total of `r pscis_all |> filter(source != 'pscis_phase2.xlsm') |> nrow()` Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments and `r pscis_reassessments |> nrow()` reassessments. 

<br>

Of the `r pscis_all |> filter(source != 'pscis_phase2.xlsm') |> nrow()` sites where fish passage assessments were completed, `r pscis_phase1 |> nrow()` were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system.  This included `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') |> nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') |> nrow() |> english::as.english()` crossings considered a "potential" barrier, and `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') |> nrow()` crossings were considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@moe2011Fieldassessment].

<!-- Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 |> filter(barrier_result == 'Unknown') |> nrow() |> english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords and ranked as "unknown" according to the provincial protocol.  -->

<br>

Reassessments were completed at `r pscis_reassessments |> nrow()` sites where PSICS data required updating.

<br>

A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output(ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, url_resource = "appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html", anchor_text = "Appendix"))`.

<br>

The "Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @moe2011Fieldassessment and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005; @bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013]. As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

## Habitat Confirmation Assessments

During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r habitat_confirmations_priorities |> dplyr::distinct(site) |> nrow()`
sites within the Morice River, Kispiox River, and Bulkley River watershed groups. A total of approximately `r habitat_confirmations_priorities |> pull(length_surveyed) |> sum(na.rm = TRUE) |> round(-3)/1000` km of stream was assessed. Electrofishing surveys were conducted at all habitat confirmation sites. Georeferenced field maps are provided in `r knitr::asis_output(if (gitbook_on) "[Attachment 1](#attach-1-maps)" else ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, url_resource = "attach-1-maps.html", anchor_text = "Attachment 1"))`.

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. 
Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}` Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in `r knitr::asis_output(if (gitbook_on) "[Attachment 2](#raw-dat)" else ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, url_resource = "raw-dat.html", anchor_text = "Attachment 2"))`. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

### Fish Sampling

In 2024, fish sampling was conducted at `r tab_fish_sites_sum |> n_distinct()` sites within `r tab_fish_sites_sum |> distinct(stream) |> nrow()` streams, with a total of `r tab_fish_summary |> dplyr::pull(count_fish) |> sum(na.rm = TRUE)` fish captured. Fork length, weight, and species were documented for each fish. PIT tags were inserted into `r fish_data_complete |> dplyr::filter(!is.na(pit_tag_id)) |> nrow()` fish.

<br>

Fork length data was used to delineate salmonids based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (>65 to 110mm), juvenile (>110mm to 140mm) and adult (>140mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-histogram).  A summary of sites assessed are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-summary) and raw data is provided in `r knitr::asis_output(if (gitbook_on) "[Attachment 2](#raw-dat)" else ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, url_resource = "raw-dat.html", anchor_text = "Attachment 2"))`. A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all). 

<br>

Results are presented in greater detail within individual habitat confirmation site appendices within this report as
well as for Sandstone Creek within @irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/) and

## Engineering Design

All sites with a design for remediation of fish passage can be found `r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(paste0("online within the Results and Discussion section of the report found ", ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, anchor_text = "here")))}else{knitr::asis_output("in Table \\@ref(tab:tab-sites-cap) by filtering using Design = yes")}`. In 2024, designs for remediation of fish passage were completed for the following sites:

 - Waterfall Creek – PSCIS 124421 - 11th Avenue.  This crossing is within New Hazelton. Waterfall Creek flows into Station Creek downstream of this site. Remediation efforts, led by Gitksan Watershed Authorities, in collaboration with SERNbc, Skeena Fisheries Commission, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Gitsxan House representives, the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society and the District of New Hazelton are tentatively planned for summer 2025. Through this year's project - SERNbc funded the  engineering design for a bridge to replace the open bottom culverts - drafted by Pacific North Coast Consulting Services. Reporting updated with 2024 data along with background information for the Station Creek and Waterfall Creek watersheds are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/) and [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/).
  
  - Tributary to Owen Creek – PSCIS crossing 197378 is located on Klate Lake Road. Through 2024/25 project activities SERNbc 
funded an engineering design completed by Pacific North Coast Consulting Services. Proposed works include the replacement of
the existing 1.0m wide round culvert with a 12m free span bridge.  This site has been earmarked for replacement through
the Bii Wenii Kwa Restoration/Recovery Plan which is a collaboration between the Wet'suwet'en Treaty Society, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 
BC Ministry of Forests, and Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, Morice Water Monitoring Trust, and Northwest Research and Monitoring. The Bii Wenii Kwa Watershed Restoration and Recovery Plan aims to improve watershed health and support both resident and anadromous fish while helping the Wet’suwet’en, and Federal and Provincial governments address habitat risks by enhancing and restoring fish habitat, consolidating existing data, prioritizing restoration work with cost estimates, and providing monitoring recommendations [@morgan2024biiwenii].
Klate Lake Road provides access to forestry areas under the tenure of Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership (YLP) which is the corporate business arm of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation.  Additionally
this road provides access to the [Nadina Mountain Provincial Park](https://bcparks.ca/nadina-mountain-park/), which features the [Nadina Mountain Trail](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/nadina-mountain-trail/) [@bcparks2025NadinaMountain]. Background information updated in 2025
and also including habitat confirmation reporting and fish sampling conducted in 2021 and 2023 is presented in @irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed  [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/).  Design drawings for the proposed bridge installation
are available [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/blob/master/data/inputs_raw/Owen Creek Trib - BRIDGE GA DESIGN SEALED IFC.pdf).

## Remediations

All sites where remediation of fish passage has been completed since 2020 can be found `r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(paste0("online within the Results and Discussion section of the report found ", ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, anchor_text = "here")))}else{knitr::asis_output("in Table \\@ref(tab:tab-sites-cap) by filtering using Remediation = yes")}`. Since 2020,
remediation of fish passage has been completed at the following sites (listed by watershed group):

### Bulkley River

  - McDowell Creek -PSCIS 58159 - Private Road. Replaced with a clear-span bridge in 2022 with remediation work led by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. Background presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/.

  - Taman Creek - PSCIS 197967 - Highway 16. Between 2022 and 2024, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replaced
  this crossing with a streambed simulation structure (ie. embedded round pipe).  Background reporting regarding the habitat confirmation 
  assessment is documented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/). 
  
### Kispiox River

  - Tributary to Skeena River - 198217 - Sik-E-Dakh Water Tower Road. Replacement of the crossing with a clear-span bridge 
  in 2024 with remediation work led by the Gitskan Watershed Authorities. Updated reporting can be found 
  [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/). 

### Morice River

  - Peacock Creek - 197962 - Morice River Forest Service Road. In 2021, the Ministry of Forests, Canfor and TC Energy
  collaborated to replace the crossing with a clear-span bridge.  Background reporting regarding the habitat confirmation and
  baseline monitoring is documented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/).
  

## Monitoring

Five streams where habitat confirmations were conducted in the past were revisited in 2024 to gather data to further inform prioritization and or to provide data for effectiveness monitoring. Below are sites visited (listed by watershed group) with details of data collected and links to reporting provided.

### Bulkley River

- Stock Creek - PSCIS 195943 - Barrett Station Rd.  Electrofishing was conducted at the sites below to understand fish community composition as part of 
both the prioritization process and baseline monitoring. Reporting updated [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting).

- Taman Creek- PSCIS 197967 - Highway 16.  Construction activities took place to replace this crossing between 2022 and 2024.  
Effectiveness monitoring was conducted in 2024.  Background information was updated  [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/taman-creek---197967---appendix.html) with results of the 2024 monitoring presented in within this document in [Taman Creek - 197967 - Appendix](#taman).

- Waterfall Creek – PSCIS 124421 - 11th Avenue.  This crossing is within New Hazelton. In addition to the aquisition of 
a design for PSCIS crossing 124421 on 11th Avenue discussed earlier - in 2024 a field visit was conducted which included a habitat survey covering the
the area from 10th avenue (Highway 16) to the waterfall located above town.  Additionally  an aerial survey was conducted with a drone to map the historic Waterfall Creek wetland areas located north of Highway 16/10th avenue (east of Churchill Street) to support restoration planning (orthomosaics available `r knitr::asis_output(if (gitbook_on) "in Table \\@ref(tab:tab-uav-imagery-cap)" else ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$report_url, url_resource = "results-and-discussion.html", anchor_text = "here"))`). Reporting updated with 2024 data along with background information for the Station Creek and Waterfall Creek watersheds are presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/) and [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/).


### Zymoetz River

- Tributary to McDonell Lake - PSCIS 8547 - McDonell Forest Service Road. This site was visited in 2024 with the intent of conducting electrofishing to support an engineering design commissioned by SERNbc (in collaboration with Giotsxan Watershed Authorities) through this project. However, water temperatures were too low for effective sampling at that time. Although preliminary data was collected to inform an engineering design, resources were ultimately redirected to Waterfall Creek in New Hazelton. This decision followed an assessment of the stream by DFO, which suggested 
the stream was unlikely to support a salmon-bearing cohort. Because the associated grant funding provided to the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities 
was from the Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund the site was not pursued further under that funding stream.

- Sandstone Creek - PSCIS 8530 - McDonell Forest Service Road.  Electrofishing was conducted at the sites below to understand fish community composition as part of both the prioritization process and baseline monitoring. Salmonids with fork lengths >60mm were PIT-tagged to facilitate long-term tracking of health and movement with data amalgamated into past reporting [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2022_reporting/).

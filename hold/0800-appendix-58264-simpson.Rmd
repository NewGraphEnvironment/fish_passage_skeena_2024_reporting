## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 3 km northwest of the town of Smithers, BC. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, and is located south of the mapped channel. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)` km upstream of the confluence of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` and Kathlyn Creek. Approximately 950 m upstream, crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`. Both crossings are within the Bulkley River watershed group.

This concrete oval culvert has a significant 1 m outlet drop, likely inhibiting fish passage. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, located south of the mapped channel. Upstream habitat includes boulder cover, gravel pockets suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning, and a healthy mature mixed forest riparian zone. Downstream habitat transitions to lower-gradient, high-value conditions with extensive gravels, deep pools (up to 90 cm), large woody debris, and abundant cover, supporting recent steelhead and historically chinook spawning, as reported by the adjacent landowner. Habitat confirmations were completed at this site and all downstream crossings to the confluence with Kathlyn Creek. The stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. According to the landowner, this crossing was originally a bridge but was replaced with the current culvert during an emergency flood event in the 1990s.

Although this culvert is on Simpson Creek, it is not currently conveying the main flow and remains mostly dry. Two 1.5 m diameter pipes run under the railway, approximately 30 m apart. The southern pipe is fully embedded with an average embedment depth of 25 cm, while the northern pipe is currently passing all stream flow. This is a high-value stream with extensive gravel areas suitable for steelhead, coho, and chinook salmon spawning upstream. The adjacent landowner has reported recent observations of steelhead spawning and has historical knowledge of chinook spawning approximately 300 m downstream from Nielsen Road.

The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road downstream to the railway, covering approximately 950 m. The upper 300 m from Nielsen Road has a steeper gradient of 5–6%, characterized by straight riffle-cascade sections with confined, channelized, dyke-like banks. Around 300 m downstream, the gradient decreases to 2–3%, transitioning into a ~50 m section with extensive aggraded material and multiple channels. Below this section, the habitat improves significantly, featuring extensive gravels, deep pools up to 90 cm, large woody debris, and diverse cover. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, located south of the mapped channel.


## Background {.unnumbered}

At the location of these crossings, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-58264)). Simpson Creek is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, and is located south of the mapped channel.

<br>

In 2012, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments by Marlim Ecological Consulting Ltd. and both were ranked as barriers [@marlimecologicalconsultingltd_2013FishPassage]. 

<br>

According to the a nearby landowner, the crossing on Nielson Road (`r as.character(my_site2)`) was originally a bridge but was replaced with the current culvert during an emergency flood event in the 1990s.

<br>

Upstream of the uppermost crossing on Nielson Road (`r as.character(my_site2)`), coho salmon and other salmonids have been documented in the past, along with cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, steelhead, mountain whitefish, and Dolly Varden [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. Approximately 360 m downstream of Nielson Road, the adjacent landowner has observed recent steelhead spawning and historically chinook spawning.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58264)). Constructed in the 1920s, this crossing is a concrete box culvert approximately 100 m in length, located beneath the CN railway with approximately 30–40 m of fill above it. It features a moderate 0.45 m outlet drop that adult fish could likely overcome but is presumed to act as a barrier to juvenile fish. The culvert's relatively steep 6% slope, minimal flow depths, and swift currents further impede fish passage. Installing baffles within the culvert would likely improve fish passage conditions.

<br>

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58245)). Located on Highway 16, this crossing had a 0.35 m outlet drop and a significant 0.85 m deep outlet pool, suggesting the culvert is undersized for the stream.

<br>

At both crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. The stream contained numerous boulders forming step pools; however, high flows at the time of assessment limited the availability of pools suitable for fish. The first pool suitable for overwintering fish, with adequately reduced flow, was located approximately 250 m downstream of the culvert. There were occasional gravels suitable for spawning and frequent large woody debris, which contributed to the formation of additional steps. `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) upstream to the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`), a distance of approximately 900 m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')`. A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250 m upstream of the railway crossing, creating a 17% gradient over a 9 m section due to a fallen tree. The stream maintained good flow through this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value and contained occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning by coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`. The stream had frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravels present despite a significant amount of fines. In the ~200 m section just upstream of the crossing, the stream maintains a low gradient and flows through agricultural fields, however, there were large cottonwoods providing sufficient riparian cover observed throughout the entire 600 m surveyed. Two logjams, each approximately 1 m in height, were observed but remain passable for fish `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58245-d01))."))``r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing an spawning.

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted below and above the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58264) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58264) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-58264). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` Dolly Varden were captured upstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-58264-d02))."))` . 


Electrofishing was also conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing on Highway 16 (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58245) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58245) and Figure

FOR THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS TO RUN WE NEED:
- `tab_cost_est_phase2` build in `tables.R` which is used by `fpr_my_cost_estimate()`

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ COMMENTED OUT BELOW. It unlikely that fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River can access Gershwin Creek upstream of this railway crossing, and although construction would be expensive and challenging, this crossing is a high priority for restoration follow-up.

<!-- `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` -->

Until the downstream railway crossing is upgraded, replacement of the upstream crossing on Highway 16 (`r as.character(my_site2)`) is not recommended. If the downstream crossing is upgraded, the Highway 16 crossing should be replaced with a bridge spanning `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is \$ COMMENTED OUT BELOW.

<!-- `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')` -->

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}


A trail runs parallel to the stream for 400 m up to the powerline, offering an excellent opportunity for community engagement. By connecting people to the land, the trail can foster stewardship and advocacy for the stream, which may lead to future restoration efforts.



PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on Gershwin Creek which provides medium to high-value habitat for salmonids, including coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on the CN Railway is a historic, exceptionally long concrete box culvert. It has been identified as a barrier to juvenile fish passage due to its 0.45 m outlet drop, steep slope, and swift currents. This culvert likely inhibits fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River from accessing upstream habitats beyond this crossing. The site was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement, however, given the significant cost and scale of such a project, the installation of baffles is recommended as a more practical interim solution to improve fish passage conditions.

Replacement of the upstream Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) is recommended only if the downstream CN Railway crossing is first upgraded, as fish passage is otherwise restricted at the railway culvert. Collectively, these crossings form a critical passage for salmonid movement within the watershed. Restoration efforts should prioritize the downstream CN Railway crossing, as its improvement would unlock access to high-value rearing and spawning habitats further upstream.

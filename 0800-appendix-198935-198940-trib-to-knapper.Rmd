## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 22 km southwest of Houston, BC. `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` flows into Knapper Creek, which joins the Morice River approximalety 2 km downstream. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located 1.3 km upstream of the confluence of the subject tributary and Knapper Creek, on spur `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`. Approximately 350 m upstream, crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`. Both crossings are within the Morice River watershed group.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At this location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198940)). There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current estimates may under-represent the watershed's size.

<br>

In 2023, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments [@irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed]. These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream and fish observed during the 2023 assessment [@irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed]. Previously, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

           scroll = F)

```

<br>

Habitat modelling outputs from `bcfishpass` indicated 1.2 km of steelhead and 1 km of coho rearing habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on spur `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` (gradients <8.5% for steelhead and <5.5% for coho). Upstream of the crossing on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`, there is 0.9 km of steelhead and 1.9 km of coho rearing habitat modelled.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on spur `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was
un-embedded, and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198940)). However, the culvert was backwatered to 30%, making it unlikely to be a barrier to fish passage. The pipe was significantly undersized for the stream, and the road appeared to be failing, likely due to a partially clogged inlet and spring freshet impacts.

<br>

PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198935)). This culvert had a significant 0.8 m deep outlet pool, and was deteriorating at the inlet. 

<br>

At all crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()`, with good flow, abundant gravels, overhanging banks, and healthy riparian vegetation, providing good rearing and spawning habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR (`r as.character(my_site2)`), down to the crossing on road/spur HM7504 (`r as.character(my_site)`), a distance of approximately 340 m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198940-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198940-d01)"))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value with good flow, abundant spawning gravels, and suitable rearing habitat in undercut banks and occasional deep pools. Historic beaver activity was evident, including a large breached dam near the upstream end of the site. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy shrub and herbaceous flood-tolerant plant community. The stream corridor, approximately 40â€“50 m wide, was bordered by mature coniferous forest on both sides.

A mature mixed forest, including cottonwood, provided excellent bank stabilization, resulting in deeply undercut banks and intermittent pools up to 60 cm deep within the surveyed area. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198935) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198935) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198935). A total of `r tab_fish_summary |>filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds')) |>  group_by(site_id) |>janitor::adorn_totals() |>filter(site_id == 'Total') |>pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and Dolly Varden.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Gold Creek FSR crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

At the time of assessment, the downstream crossing on road/spur HM7504 was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR. However, should restoration activities proceed at crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, replacement with a bridge spanning `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` contains moderate-value rearing and spawning habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Electrofishing at the time of assessment confirmed the presence of rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, cutthroat/rainbow trout hybrids, and Dolly Varden. Habitat modelling identified 1.2 km of steelhead rearing habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, with approximately 300 m less upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`. There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current modelling may under-represent the watershed's size.

Should restoration activities proceed, efforts should focus on PSCIS crossing` r as.character(my_site2)` on Gold Creek FSR, which had a small outlet drop and a deep outlet pool. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on Road/Spur HM7504 was backwatered and not presumed to be a barrier to fish passage. Both crossings were noted as undersized for the stream.

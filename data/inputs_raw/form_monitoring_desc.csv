Parameter,Description
dewatering,Have the remediation works led to dewatering of the channel due to substrate aggradation or other factors?
velocity,Are flow velocities similar to those within the natural channel?  Are they expected to exceed swim speeds of particular fish species/life stages of interest?
constriction,Have the remediation works led to constriction of the channel.   Compare channel width underneath structure and within construction footprint to average channel widths upstream and downstream?
substrate,Is the substrate within/under and adjacent to the remediated structure generally equivalent to that found upstream and downstream where natural channel conditions exist?
riparian,What is the condition of the riparian area within the construction footprint? 
uav_flight,Was a flight conducted with unmmanned aerial vehicle to document conditions at time of monitoring?
flow_depth,What are the flow depths at the time of assessment within project footprint. Are depths expected to be sufficient to facilitat upstream passage for specific species/life stages of interest?
stability,Does the structure appear to be stable or is there evidence of erosion/shifting?
revegetation,How were riparian areas rehabillitated and are they improving fish habitat value?
cover,"Is cover available for fish within the construction footprint in the form of overhanging vegetation, large/small woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, etc?"
maintenance,"If required, provide maintenance recommendations."
recommendations,"General recommendations for follow up.  Could include revegetation, addition of substrate, fish sampling, etc."

The stream had a steeper gradient with predominantly boulder cover and pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning. Pools were infrequent. The upper end of the site was located just upstream of a short cascade with a 20% gradient. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy, mature mixed forest. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat, particularly below Nielsen Road, as this is a known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. The culvert on Nielsen Road has a significant outlet drop and likely limits fish passage. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho.

An observation is made when a surveyor makes a visit to a Design Component (block, transect, sample station) on a specific date at a specific time and enumerates the target species or its sign. Observations may include information on count, species, sex, age class, activity, and survey conditions. Observations may result from various survey methodologies, such as stratified random block, distance sampling, reconnaissance, mark-resight, wildlife camera traps, pellet group counts, and snow tracking. Each observation may be geo-referenced individually or by association with a specific Design Component.

As a resource to support communities, Urgent and Primary Care Centres are one of the mechanisms to immediately address the urgent and ongoing care needs of all patients within a community.

Urgent and Primary Care Centres are open to all patients in select communities. For example, they may become the regular clinic for patients without a family doctor or nurse practitioner until another practice or provider within the community can be identified. Urgent and Primary Care Centres also provide alternative care options for patients with a regular family doctor or nurse practitioner often unable to make same-day or next day appointments, and are designed to ensure continuity of care by communicating the relevant information back to a patient’s regular primary care provider.

Urgent and Primary Care Centres provide better access to same-day, urgent, non-emergency health care, including in the evening and on weekends. They provide an alternative to visiting emergency departments for issues that do not need to be seen in a hospital. For example, patients who require medical attention within 12 to 24 hours for something like a sprain, minor cut or burn can visit an Urgent and Primary Care Centre.

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known.  It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage.  This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species.",35bbac7c-2e2f-4587-9108-f4aa1e862809,894fe0da-8bdf-4c30-b08e-471e33163b13,https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/WHSE_FISH.FISS_OBSTACLES_PNT_SP/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

A Range Tenure is an area of Crown rangeland where a Range Act tenure applies. Tenure holders access a defined amount of forage through grazing (measured in Animal Unit Months) or hay (tonnage). Range Tenures apply only to Crown Land. In some cases, digital boundaries may overlap Private Land but these lands are not part of the Grazing area (as described in the legal description). Grazing may overlap waterbodies during drawdown (also described legally in the Tenure documents and where applicable, Range Use Plan). Livestock may graze islands and large bodies of water may act as Natural Range Barriers.

March 3, 2023: Updates to the Range Tenure attribute table as described.
 
Please contact Nancy.Elliot@gov.bc.ca if you have questions.

To guide your use:

1. Layer contains RETIRED, PENDING, and ACTIVE Tenures (=Licenses and Permits);
Select ACTIVE under attribute LIFE_CYCLE_STATUS_CODE to isolate all active tenures (status refers to spatial boundary status - therefore, a spatial boundary must be Retired in the Forest Tenure Administration system to have a status of retired);

2. Unique ID for Polygon is by RAN# in attribute FOREST_FILE_ID. Each tenure has own its RAN# (e.g. RAN07777).  Multiple areas (polygons) belonging to the same tenure may have same RAN# with unique map block ids (e.g. RAN07777 A, RAN07777 B)

3. The field SUM_TENURE_ACTIVE_AREA_HA will provide, where LIFE_CYCLE_STATUS_CODE is ACTIVE, the total tenure area in Ha. For single block (polygon) tenures, this will be the same area as the polygon. Where there are multiple blocks, this will be the total sum area of all Active blocks. (Note this does not include PENDING or RETIRED tenure areas. Area is for Approved and Active Tenure boundaries. A block may be Approved but Pending, and therefore is not included). Review data for multipart vs multi polygons

4. AUTHORIZED_USE and TOTAL_ANNUAL_USE are for the entire Tenure; where there are multiple blocks, the total is over all blocks, seasonally distributed through different pastures

3.	FILE_TYPE_CODE contains information on the type of Permit:
•	E01 - Grazing License
•	E02 - Grazing Permit
•	H01 - Haycutting License
•	H02 - Haycutting Permit

4. IF YOU ARE DOING SPATIAL ANALYSIS based on AREA --- Please note that tenures overlap either partially or wholly amongst tenure holders. One area may be shared by more than one Tenure holder and therefore there will be multiple congruent or partially overlapping polygons (multipart).  If you want to do SPATIAL ANALYSIS based strictly on area, you must collapse or flatten the data using DISSOLVE so that the polygons are 1:1 with the land base (suggested approach)",10b1b187-1ef5-421f-8aa2-f716379fdb99,4ebd9263-d104-4b85-b94d-01abb4459455,https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.FTEN_RANGE_POLY_SVW/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

Wildlife-related telemetry is also known as radio tagging, radio-tracking. Advances in the field of wildlife telemetry have made it possible to acquire detailed data on many aspects of wildlife biology, including habitat use, home range size, mortality and survivorship, and migration timing and routes. Since many wildlife species are secretive and difficult to observe, radio-telemetry has provided a valuable tool to learn more about their respective life histories.

Programs that offer early intervention, transitional care or other services that supplement and facilitate primary and adjunctive therapies; which offer community mental health education programs; or which link people who are in need of treatment with appropriate providers. 

Programs that provide preventive, diagnostic and treatment services in a variety of community and hospital-based settings to help people achieve, maintain and enhance a state of emotional well-being, personal empowerment and the skills to cope with everyday demands without excessive stress or reliance on alcohol or other drugs. Treatment may include emotional support, introspection and problem-solving assistance using a variety of modalities and approaches, and medication, as needed, for individuals who have a substance use disorder involving alcohol and/or other drugs or for people who range from experiencing difficult life transitions or problems in coping with daily living to those with severe, chronic mental illnesses that seriously impact their lives. 

Multidisciplinary programs, often offered on an inpatient basis with post-discharge outpatient therapy, that provide comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services for individuals who have anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, bulimia or a related eating disorder. Treatment depends on the specific type of eating disorder involved but typically involves psychotherapy, nutrition education, family counseling, medication and hospitalization, if required, to stabilize the patient's health.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. However, in late fire seasons imagery acquired after September 30th may be used.

This layer is considered an interim product for the 1-year-later burn severity dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SP). Mapping conducted during the following growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality.

#### Methodology:

•	 Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes

•	 Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images

•	 Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR

•	 Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5)

•	 Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity)

•	 Mask out water bodies using a satellite-derived water layer

•	 Apply region-based filters to reduce noise

•	 Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control

•	 Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing",04c5ad28-d8eb-4c49-90c5-48b9b98fdfe9,cf6002fa-b7be-4674-b3f9-e749276a0894,https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

(Election Act, s. 1, 81)

This dataset contains spatial points representative of voting opportunities for use in provincial electoral events.  

Each voting place is identified by a three character electoral district code (e.g. CHC is an abbreviation of the Chilliwack electoral district).  A voting place is identified by a standard address ID, street address, locality and building name.

A voting place is classified by type based on its use in an electoral event; Advance - for use in advance voting opportunities, General - for use on general voting day, and Advance and General which are used for throughout the voting period of electoral event.

The status of a voting place is indicative of whether a voting place is proposed or has been confirmed for an electoral event.  The event name and event date fields indicates which electoral event a voting place is used for.

This dataset includes voting places for the 2017 Provincial General Election, the 2018 West-Kelowna By-election, the 2019 Nanaimo By-election, the 2020 Provincial General Election, the 2022 Surrey South By-election, the 2023 Langford-Juan de Fuca By-election, the 2023 Vancouver-Mount Pleasant By-election and the 2024 Provincial General Election.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th.

#### Methodology:

•	 Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes

•	 Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images

•	 Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR

•	 Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5)

•	 Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity)

•	 Apply region-based filters to reduce noise

•	 Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control

•	 Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing",c58a54e5-76b7-4921-94a7-b5998484e697,6c9070cd-1014-45ee-a7ca-fc320c488ed5,https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SP/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

The ""Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) - Priority Deferral Areas"" dataset described here reflects the Priority Deferral Areas defined and published by the Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) on November 2, 2021.  It gives an overall picture of the Technical Advisory Panel’s priority recommendations for harvest deferrals and is a combination of:
<ul>
  <li><a href=""https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/a7384d1a-a0e8-4c97-ab15-6b2c6ea88911"">Prioritized Big-treed Old Growth</a>; </li>

</ul>
<br>
The above three forest types which comprise the Priority Deferral Areas can spatially overlap.  For example, a forested type can meet the criteria for both Ancient Forest and Prioritized Large-treed Old Growth.  The individual spatial layers for <a href=""https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/a7384d1a-a0e8-4c97-ab15-6b2c6ea88911"">Prioritized Big-treed Old Growth</a>, <a href=""https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/b43bc442-8a0f-42f2-b085-04f4771b2f28"">Ancient Forest</a>, and <a href=""https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/561edb4f-8abc-4583-94ff-d16b4336478e"">Remnant Old Ecosystems</a> must each be consulted separately to understand where each occurs.

However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geospatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information in a species’ recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry.html). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geospatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (“biophysical attributes”) that complete the definition of a species’ critical habitat.

This dataset includes both “final” critical habitat, and “proposed” critical habitat within British Columbia, as it is depicted in the recovery documents. “Proposed” critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term “final”, it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. 

In most cases the geospatial information provided includes detailed geospatial polygons containing critical habitat, as well as overlaying “grid squares”.  These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to reference the general areas in which the detailed critical habitat polygons occur. In some cases where a species has been deemed “data-sensitive”, such as species included in the Province of British Columbia’s List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=24C3179F7D764A8F906DB352B98253D2, detailed polygons are not provided, but may be made available on request.

This file includes data from the Pacific regional branch of the Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment and Climate Change Canada). It does not include critical habitat identified in other regions within Environment and Climate Change Canada (with the exception of critical habitat information for Whitebark Pine which spans BC and Alberta).

Critical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species’ critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species"". Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic “protection” designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection. Note that the Province of B.C. considers recovery planning documents, including the identification of critical habitat by the federal government, as science advice only.

The structure density polygons were buffered at 2.75km and merged to create polygons where the structure density was greater than or equal to 25 structures per square kilometer. These polygons were spatially joined to a point communities feature class and a community name was transferred to the polygons. Where multiple communities were within the same polygon a priority system based mainly on community size was used to determine a community name. Where no community was within the polygon a near process was run to determine the closest community. Where discrete polygons had the same community name a unique value was appended to the name to make all the names unique. 

In the densely populated urban areas the polygons were very large and enclosed multiple communities. In these cases a manual process of splitting the polygons was used to create smaller community polygons.

The Elk Valley Water Quality Plan was developed by Teck with input from the public, First Nations, governments, technical experts and other stakeholders. The purpose of the Plan is to identify a strategy and implement solutions to address increasing selenium and nitrate water concentrations within the Valley, and assess and track levels of cadmium and sulphate in waters; while at the same time allowing for continued sustainable mining in the Valley. The Plan also lays out a strategy to address calcite formation associated with historical and current mining activity.

The Plan was submitted to the British Columbia Minister of Environment for approval on July 22, 2014. More information about the development of the Plan, including consultation materials, summaries and reports, can be found at www.teck.com/ElkValley.

This polygon dataset was derived from the PSTA threat rating raster by using the Raster to Polygon conversion tool in ArcGIS 10.3. The following describes how the raster feature class was created. The three described data layers (fire density, head fire intensity and spotting impact) were combined using a weighted sum process. Weights were assigned as 30% fire density, 60% head fire intensity (90th percentile) and 10% spotting impact. These weighted values were added together to produce a final fire threat analysis value ranging theoretically between zero to 100. Although the classification scheme theoretically ranged from zero to 100, the highest value in the data was 81. The classes were then scaled to balance out the distribution of values while still maintaining meaningful thresholds of fire density, head fire intensity, and spotting at higher levels. Areas with a final value of zero consisted of areas that had no record of wildfire, were typed as non-fuel (such as alpine rock, glaciers and ocean areas), and were too distant to be at risk of spotting from nearby fuels. Other very low values could occur due to zero values in one or two of the three categories, such as areas of flammable fuels with no record of a large fire burning nearby (i.e. fire density equals zero) or non-fuel areas that are only at a slight risk of spotting. Water bodies were overlaid on the raster and assigned to their own class, -1, which is effectively zero. A private managed forest land and private land mask was applied to the data due to fuel typing limitations in these areas. Each of these were given their own class. private managed forest land is class -2 and private land is class -3. The weighting system integrated the three identified components of fire threat: fire occurrence (fire density); suppression effort and fire impacts (head fire intensity); and spotting. The results of the final Wildfire Threat Analysis were then assigned to 10 classes to produce a detailed map of fire threats throughout British Columbia. These 10 classes represent a subjective best estimate of relative fire threats, taking into account fire occurrence history, predicted fire intensity under extreme conditions, and spotting impact.

The fire density layer was analyzed using fires with final sizes greater than 4.0 hectares from 1950 onwards. It was updated in 2021. These were given a weight of one (1) in the analysis, while large fires (> 500 ha) were given a weight of 5, in order to reflect the much greater cost and damage usually associated with larger fires. A kernel density analysis was conducted to represent the historic fire data as a seamless surface representing fire occurrence across the province; a 10 km search radius was chosen, and the pixel size was 50 m. The ArcGIS kernel density function fits a smooth surface to a spatial point frequency dataset, representing actual fire origin points as random samples from a smooth probability surface. The analysis search radius was 10 kilometers and this distance was reflected in the mapped output classes; thus, the fire density at any point on the landscape is a modeled probability value reflecting the number of historic fires found within a radius of 10 kilometers, or within a 314 km2 circle around the point of interest. Note that this is different from a simple point density, and the values in the fire density layer classes do not represent the exact numbers of historic fires within the search radius; closer and more clustered fires are weighted higher within that circle, and this can result in significantly higher values than may be expected compared with a simple point search.The output values therefore represent a modeled probability approximately representing the number of nearby fires (4 ha and greater, treating 500+ ha fires as 5 individual events) since 1950.

The Head Fire Intensity (HFI) data layer was developed using the 90th percentile fire weather index value for an interpolated and elevation-adjusted analysis of weather station values. This value represents the daily FWI value at which 10% of all interpolated observations at that location exceed the value identified. These were calculated by interpolating daily weather records from the network of active and archived BC Wildfire Service and other (e.g. Environment Canada, BC Ministry of Environment Snow Pillow, etc. ) weather stations. The HFI (90th percentile) values were classified using accepted thresholds of fire intensity and fire suppression effort. The HFI classes used in the final threat layer are different from the defined HFI classes derived from the Fire Behavior Prediction System because the values need to be spread across 10 categories. The intensity values in the HFI data layer therefore represent daily peak burning HFI values representative of a small number of days (~ 1-15) in an average year based on the fuels identified in provincial inventory in early 2021. By definition, these represent high to extreme values for any given location. The final classification scheme for the HFI (90th percentile weather) layer was chosen to represent accepted fire intensity thresholds (in kW/m) associated with suppression difficulty, along with some additional classes added to further discriminate between intensity levels at the high end (i.e. crown fires).Water bodies were overlaid on the raster and assigned their own class, -1.

Spotting was modeled by fuel type and by distance class from a given fuel type pixel. The risk of spotting within a given pixel was analyzed based on the risk presented by the surrounding fuel pixels, with distance radii based on fuel type. Distance class categories were analyzed as concentric circles around the target fuel patch, with higher ranking values associated with shorter distances, and with more volatile fuel types. The chance of spotting was considered to be “nil” for distances over two kilometers. Spotting values represent the estimated threat associated with 12 relevant fuel type-distance classes. The relative threat associated with each fuel type-distance class was ranked (“Spotting Rank”), based on expert opinions on the most frequent spotting concerns observed during wildfires. The rank values were assigned risk scores (weighting factor), which were adjusted to normalize the areas (since the larger concentric circles cover much more area than smaller ones). Each raster pixel (50 meter resolution) was then assigned a total score based on the sum of risk values contributed by all pixels within a radius of 1-2 kilometers. Based on this total score, the landscape was categorized into 10 spotting classes ranging from low to extreme.The classes were created by automatic classification, using the “natural breaks (Jenks)” setting of the ArcGIS 10.1 Spatial Analyst extension. Differences are caused by fuel type classes and distances, with no consideration given at this time to elevation or dominant wind direction. Future versions of this analysis will likely address both of these factors.Water bodies were overlaid on the raster and assigned their own class, -1.",62be8626-4768-45b6-adec-265fab94e061,0dc6f689-4716-4d28-9c98-0c5193ea5e3f,https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/WHSE_LAND_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCE.PROT_PSTA_SPOTTING_IMPACT_SP/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

Operational fuel management is defined as the process of changing forest fuel to reduce aggressive fire behaviour. This may include treatments such as thinning, spacing and pruning trees, and removal of needles and woody debris from the forest floor. The intent is to reduce fuel load in the forest and reduce the potential for devastating wildfires. The Operational Fuel Treatment program assists local governments and First Nations to undertake operational fuel treatments that are set out in a prescription for areas identified as priorities in the Community Wildfire Protection/Resiliency Plan (CWPP/CWRP). The primary objective of the program is to maximize the number of hectares treated in areas that pose the greatest risk of wildfire to communities.

The Community Resiliency Investment (CRI) program is intended to reduce the risk and impact of wildfire to communities in BC through community funding, supports and priority fuel management activities on provincial Crown land.  Under the program more than 120 First Nations and local governments have received funding. The CRI Program, launched in 2018, is an evolution of the Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative (SWPI) that ran 2004-2017. There are two delivery and funding mechanisms within CRI: FireSmart Community Funding and Supports (FCFS), and Crown Land Wildfire Risk Reduction (WRR), launched in 2019.

As defined in the FireSmart manual, the WUI is any area where combustible forest fuel is found adjacent to homes, farm structures or other outbuildings. This may occur at the interface, where development and forest fuel (vegetation) meet at a well-defined boundary, or in the intermix, where development and forest fuel intermingle with no clearly defined boundary. Historically in BC, structure densities are used to define the human structure interface boundary of the WUI for fire and risk management planning purposes. It identifies the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. A two-kilometre buffer distance is then applied to represent a reasonable maximum distance that embers can travel from a wildfire to ignite a structure.

The British Columbia Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) Grizzly Bear 2015 Condition Assessment is a strategic, broad scale (provincial) assessment of the status of Grizzly Bear population and habitat indicators in 2015. The conceptual model used for this assessment is derived from the Interim Assessment Protocol for Grizzly Bear in British Columbia (Tier 1 Provincial Scale Grizzly Bear Assessment Protocol) prepared for British Columbia’s Cumulative Effects Framework Values Foundation Steering Committee, 2017 (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/cumulative-effects-framework/value-assessments-protocols). 

This dataset was generated from existing summaries of grizzly bear status, mortality data, Geographic Information System (GIS) data, and results from spatial modelling. The assessment units are the BC Landscape Units (see link below in Lineage Statement) to assess the mortality and habitat at the landscape scale, as they are analogous to the home range size of a female grizzly bear. The data inputs used in the GIS analysis that generated this assessment dataset are from 2015, and relied on the availability of data that cover the full extent of the province. More detailed information may be available at the regional or sub-regional level that can inform finer scale grizzly bear assessments for operational land and resource decision making. Please refer to the BC Cumulative Effects website linked above for information on regional or sub-regional CEF projects.

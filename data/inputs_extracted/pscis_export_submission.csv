Fish sampling was conducted in a 75-meter stretch downstream and a 50-meter stretch upstream of the culvert, and fish 60 mm or greater were tagged with PIT tags. There are baffles made of metal in the culvert and Â¾ of the pipe is embedded with streambed material. The outlet of the pipe sits on a large pile of rip rap creating a 30 cm cascade that occurs approximately a meter after the outlet of the pipe.  There are two overflow pipes each at 0.9 m in diamter.        . 15:58:48",125261,2024-09-11T15:58:48Z,reassessment

1,Sandstone creek,8530_ds_ef1,"Site 8530_ds_ef1. The stream had good habitat with several pools. The top of the site was located at the culvert outlet, while the bottom was blocked with a stop net and marked with flagging. The site was divided into three sections for sampling, with fish processed separately and returned to the approximate locations where they were captured. All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with PIT tags."
2,Sandstone Creek,8530_us_ef1,"Site 8530_us_ef1. The stream had a few pools near the top end of the site, which was marked with flagging. Multiple fish were captured, including potential rainbow trout and cutthroat trout hybrids, with numerous photos taken for documentation. Approximately midway through the site, a metal pole structure was present to prevent large woody debris from moving downstream. The stream contained abundant gravels suitable for spawning.All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with PIT tags."
3,Tributary to Knapper creek,198935_ds_ef1,"Site 198935_ds_ef1. Electrofishing was conducted only in the culvert's outlet pool due to its high fish density. The downstream habitat appeared to be in good condition. The site length was limited to the size of the outlet pool, approximately 8m, and was marked with flagging tape.

4,Tributary to Knapper Creek,198935_us,"Site 198935_us. The stream was surveyed upstream for ~700m upstream. The stream exhibited medium-value habitat with a good flow and abundant gravels throughout. A mature mixed forest, including cottonwood, provided excellent bank stabilization, resulting in deeply undercut banks and intermittent pools up to 60cm deep within the surveyed area. Electrofishing conducted downstream of the crossing captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and Dolly Varden. Upstream sampling captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids. The low-gradient habitat is suitable for cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and coho juvenile rearing, as well as adfluvial and anadromous spawning. A sizeable beaver dam complex was present at the upper end of the surveyed area, coinciding with the confluence of a tributary mapped in the Freshwater Atlas. There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current mapping may misrepresent the watershed's size. This remains unconfirmed, but LiDAR analysis could be used to verify these connections."
5,Tributary to Knapper Creek,198940_us,"Site 198940_us. The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR, down to this crossing on road/spur HM7504, approximately 340m. This section of stream provided medium-value habitat, with good flow, abundant gravels for spawning, and suitable rearing areas within undercut banks and occasional deep pools. Evidence of historic beaver activity is present throughout the area surveyed, including one large breached dam near the upstream end of the site. The riparian zone consists of a healthy shrub and herbaceous flood-tolerant plant community. The stream corridor is approximately 40‚Äì50m wide, bordered by mature coniferous forest on both sides.  Electrofishing above Gold FSR upstream captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids."
6,Tributary to Knapper creek,198935_us_ef1,Site 198935_us_ef1. Electrofishing was conducted from the culvert to a large pool approximately 30m upstream. The stream featured gravels suitable for spawning. The top of the site was marked with flagging.
7,Tributary to Knapper Creek,198940_ds,"Site 198940_ds. The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR, down to this crossing on road/spur HM7504, and then a further 300m downstream. Downstream of this crossing, the stream had good flow, abundant gravels, and extensive overhanging banks with healthy riparian vegetation, providing suitable rearing habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Abundant gravels were also present for spawning. A culvert assessment was completed in 2023, along with a UAV flight survey. The road is failing near the culvert, and the pipe is exceptionally long. It is recommended that the crossing be replaced with an open bottom structure or a streambed simulation design. While this crossing poses more of a concern for fish migration, remediation is still recommended."
8,Stock creek,195943_ds_ef1,"Site 195943_ds_ef1. This stream flows through agricultural and cattle areas and had very low water levels at the time of assessment, reportedly the lowest observed by local landowners. Electrofishing from 30 m downstream of the culvert up to the outlet pool captured only two fish, fewer than expected given the pool‚Äôs size and depth, and the stream‚Äôs nice habitat. Conductivity was extremely high, potentially due to cattle activity. The bottom of the site was marked with flagging."
9,Stock creek,195943_us_ef1,"Site 195943_us_ef1. The stream appears to have quality habitat at higher flows, but extremely low flows at the time of assessment resulted in few pools suitable for fish. Electrofishing conducted from the culvert on Barrett Station Road upstream ~40 m but yielded no fish, which was unexpected given the habitat. The large outlet drop at the culvert may be inhibiting fish passage, and extremely high conductivity may be impacting fish presence. The top of the site was marked with flagging."
10,Simpson Creek,203122_us,"Site 203122_us. The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road downstream to the railway, covering approximately 950m. The upper 300m from Nielsen Road has a steeper gradient of 5‚Äì6%, characterized by straight riffle-cascade sections with confined, channelized, dyke-like banks. Around 300m downstream, the gradient decreases to 2‚Äì3%, transitioning into a ~50m section with extensive aggraded material and multiple channels. Below this section, the habitat improves significantly, featuring extensive gravels, deep pools up to 90cm, large woody debris, and diverse cover. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system.  Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of coho,  Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, and is located south of the mapped channel."
11,Simpson Creek,58264_ds_ef1,"Site 58264_ds_ef1. The stream was electrofished from a stop net located 25m downstream of the culvert upstream to the culvert outlet. The outlet pool was too deep to fish entirely, so only the accessible half was safely sampled. The habitat primarily consisted of boulders with frequent pools, providing excellent conditions for fish. A well-developed, mature riparian zone on both sides of the stream offered additional cover and habitat complexity. Bottom of site WP 366."
12,Simpson Creek,58264_ds_ef2,"Site 58264_ds_ef2. Electrofishing was conducted on a stream section accessed through private property with permission from the landowner. Sampling occurred from WP 367 to WP 368, covering approximately 30m, with a stop net placed at the downstream end. The site was located ~360m downstream of the Nielsen Road crossing. The area featured excellent habitat with several deep pools and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Numerous fish were captured, including coho. The riparian zone on both sides of the stream was healthy and well-developed, providing additional cover and habitat complexity."
13,Simpson Creek,58264_us_ef1,"Site 58264_us_ef1. The stream was electrofished from the culvert inlet upstream for approximately 35m, with a stop net placed at the downstream end. The habitat was excellent, featuring undercut banks, numerous pools, and a mature, healthy riparian zone providing ample cover and habitat complexity. The top of the site was marked at WP 369."
14,Simpson Creek,58245_us,"Site 58245_us. The stream was surveyed from the railway downstream to Lake Kathlyn Road, covering approximately 1km. The upper 750m of the stream is in relatively good condition, with mostly intact riparian vegetation, abundant gravels, deep pools, and large woody debris throughout. The lower 250‚Äì500m is heavily impacted by adjacent private lands, with riparian vegetation removal, stream channelization, and bank armouring. Extensive beaver activity was observed within the lower ~300m, with dams ranging from 0.4 to 1m in height. An additional crossing was noted on private land just upstream of Lake Kathlyn Road on a driveway. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of coho,  Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids."
15,Simpson Creek,58245_ds,"Site 58245_ds. The stream was surveyed for approximately 70m from Lake Kathlyn Road to its confluence with Kathlyn Creek. It runs adjacent to the road on one side and private property on the other. Riparian vegetation is minimal on the private property side, with only shrubs present along the roadside. Multiple sections of bank armouring and channelization were observed near private land. Substrate consists primarily of fines and cobble, with only small pockets of gravel. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of coho,  Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids."
16,Comeau Creek,198916_us,"Site 198916_us. This survey covers the area from the railway culvert (crossing 198916, ~100m long and from the 1920s) upstream to the crossing on Highway 16 (crossing 198913), spanning approximately 900m. A separate habitat confirmation was conducted upstream of Highway 16. Therefore, this site encompasses both 198916_us and 198913_ds. A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250m upstream of the culvert, creating a 17% gradient over a 9m section due to a fallen tree. The stream had good flow in this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. Occasional pockets of gravels suitable for coho, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout spawning were present.  Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing. WP79 marks the confluence with a steel bridge on private land. This crossing is located on Comeau Creek, which is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas as flowing southwest into the Skeena River. In reality, it flows southwest then turns north, crossing highway 16 and the CN railway before joining the Skeena River. See the 2024 report for a map of the corrected streamline."
17,Comeau Creek,198916_ds,"Site 198916_ds. The stream was surveyed downstream of the culvert for 300m, ending at waypoint 378. A large, bent, and unused pipe‚Äîpossibly a former water intake‚Äîran the entire length of the survey area. The stream contained numerous boulders forming step pools, but high flow at the time of assessment limited the number of pools suitable for fish. Occasional gravels for spawning and frequent large woody debris creating additional steps were observed. The first pool suitable for overwintering fish with adequately reduced flow was located approximately 250m downstream of the culvert. Fish sampling captured cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden downstream of the railway crossing, and Dolly Varden upstream. This crossing is located on Comeau Creek, which is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas as flowing southwest into the Skeena River. In reality, it flows southwest then turns north, crossing highway 16 and the CN railway before joining the Skeena River. See the 2024 report for a map of the corrected streamline."
18,Comeau Creek,198913_us,"Site 198913_us. The stream has frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravel present despite a significant amount of fines. It has a low gradient near the culvert and flows through agricultural fields, but maintains sufficient riparian cover with large cottonwoods throughout the 600m survey. A landowner-constructed bridge with two culverts is located ~250m upstream of the highway crossing. Two ~1m high logjams are present. Electrofishing downstream of the highway crossing captured both dolly varden and cutthroat trout, while only dolly varden were captured upstream.  This crossing is located on Comeau Creek, which is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas as flowing southwest into the Skeena River. In reality, it flows southwest then turns north, crossing highway 16 and the CN railway before joining the Skeena River. See the 2024 report for a map of the corrected streamline."
19,Comeau Creek,198916_ds_ef1,"Site 198916_ds_ef1. The electrofishing site began at the stop net located approximately 35m downstream of the culvert and extended upstream to just below the log forming the outlet of the culvert pool. This section was designated as site 198916_ds_ef1. The section above the log to the culvert contained several deeper pools formed by large woody debris, where the majority of fish were captured. This section was designated as a separate sampling site, 198916_ds_ef2, due to its distinct habitat characteristics."
20,Comeau Creek,198916_ds_ef2,"Site 198916_ds_ef2. This site consisted of the culvert outlet pool and approximately 2m of stream downstream of the outlet pool control. This section featured several deeper pools formed by large woody debris, providing complex habitat where the majority of fish were captured. Electrofishing was conducted simultaneously with the downstream site (198916_ds_ef1) without the use of a separate stop net. The fishing effort for this site was recorded as 100 seconds."
21,Comeau Creek,198916_us_ef1,"Site 198916_us_ef1. Electrofishing was conducted from the inlet of the railway culvert upstream for approximately 43m, resulting in the capture of only three Dolly Varden. This section featured steeper step-pool habitat with extensive boulder cover. The stop net placed at the culvert inlet failed midway through the assessment."
22,Comeau Creek,198913_ds_ef1,Site 198913_ds_ef1. Fished the outlet pool of the culvert. Nice deep pool with Dolly Vardon and cutthroat trout captured. Site marked with flagging tape.
23,Comeau Creek,198913_ds_ef2,Site 198913_ds_ef2. Nice stream with pools suitable for overwintering fish and gravels for spawning. Electrofishing was conducted from 20m downstream up to the outflow of the outlet pool. Cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden were captured. The bottom of the site is marked with flagging.
24,Comeau Creek,198913_us_ef1,Site 198913_us_ef1. Deep pools suitable for overwintering fish and gravels for spawning were present. Electrofishing was conducted from the culvert inlet upstream for approximately 30m. The top of the site was marked with flagging.
25,Simpson Creek,58264_us,"Site 58264_us. The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road upstream for approximately 650m, to roughly 200m upstream of the powerlines. The stream had a steeper gradient with predominantly boulder cover and pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning. Pools were infrequent. The upper end of the site was located just upstream of a cascade with 20% gradient for roughly 8m. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy, mature mixed forest. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat, particularly below Nielsen Road, as this is a known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. The culvert on Nielsen Road has a significant outlet drop and likely limits fish passage.  Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of coho,  Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids."
26,Buck Creek,buck_falls,"Site buck_falls. Buck falls are located just downstream of the Buck Flats Road bridge on the Buck Creek mainstem - mapped in the freshwater atlas as 46.7km upstream of its confluence with the Bulkley River. The falls consist of a series of four distinct vertical and cascade sections distributed over approximately 200m of stream, ranging from 1 - 4m in height."

Waterfall Creek ,198106_us,198106,us,,2024-09-24T22:29:35Z,AI LS,475,high,,"The stream is slightly constricted by residential yards for the first ~200 m before widening into a more natural channel with healthy shrub and cottonwood riparian vegetation. Abundant gravels are present suitable for Dolly Varden and rainbow trout spawning. Intermittent pools up to 50 cm deep are scattered throughout. A trap and truck operation led by the Chicago Creek Society moves coho from a fence set up near the confluence of Station Creek with the Bulkley River to upstream of Highway 16 on Waterfall Creek annually. Coho from below fence had not yet been transferred into the stream, at the time of assessment.",,
Gershwin creek ,198913_us,198913,us,,2024-09-25T20:36:25Z,LS JD,600,high,mod,"The stream has frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravel present despite a significant amount of fines. It has a low gradient near the culvert and flows through agricultural fields, but maintains sufficient riparian cover with large cottonwoods throughout the 600 m survey. A landowner-constructed bridge with two culverts is located ~250 m upstream of the highway crossing. Two ~1 m high logjams are present but remain passable for fish. Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing.

Gershwin creek ,198916_ds,198916,ds,,2024-09-25T18:22:54Z,LS JD,300,medium,high,"The stream was surveyed downstream of the culvert for 300 m, ending at waypoint 378. A large, bent, and unused pipe—possibly a former water intake—ran the entire length of the survey area. The stream contained numerous boulders forming step pools, but high flow at the time of assessment limited the number of pools suitable for fish. Occasional gravels for spawning and frequent large woody debris creating additional steps were observed. The first pool suitable for overwintering fish with adequately reduced flow was located approximately 250 m downstream of the culvert. Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing. ",0,CT;DV
Gershwin Creek,198916_us,198916,us,,2024-09-25T17:58:39Z,AI JO,900,medium,high,"This survey covers the area from the railway culvert (crossing 198916, ~100m long and from the 1920s) upstream to the crossing on Highway 16 (crossing 198913), spanning approximately 900 m. A separate habitat confirmation was conducted upstream of Highway 16. Therefore, this site encompasses both 198916_us and 198913_ds. A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250 m upstream of the culvert, creating a 17% gradient over a 9 m section due to a fallen tree. The stream had good flow in this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. Occasional pockets of gravels suitable for coho, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout spawning were present.  Electrofishing was conducted and Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout were captured above and below the highway crossing. WP79 markes the confluence with a steel bridge on private land. ",0,CT;DV
Tributary to Knapper Creek ,198935_us,198935,us,,2024-09-18T17:29:15Z,AI,700,medium,high,"The stream was surveyed upstream for ~700 m. The stream exhibited medium-value habitat with a good flow and abundant gravels throughout. A mature mixed forest, including cottonwood, provided excellent bank stabilization, resulting in deeply undercut banks and intermittent pools up to 60 cm deep within the surveyed area. Electrofishing conducted downstream of the crossing captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and Dolly Varden. Upstream sampling captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids. The low-gradient habitat is suitable for cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and coho juvenile rearing, as well as adfluvial and anadromous spawning. A sizeable beaver dam complex was present at the upper end of the surveyed area, coinciding with the confluence of a tributary mapped in the Freshwater Atlas. There is suspected interconnection between wetlands in this watershed and adjacent watersheds, suggesting the current mapping may misrepresent the watershed's size. This remains unconfirmed, but LiDAR analysis could be used to verify these connections.",897,CT
Tributary to Knapper Creek ,198940_ds,198940,ds,,2024-09-18T20:28:30Z,AI,300,medium,high,"The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR, down to this crossing on road/spur HM7504, and then a further 300m downstream. Downstream of this crossing, the stream had good flow, abundant gravels, and extensive overhanging banks with healthy riparian vegetation, providing suitable rearing habitat for coho, rainbow trout, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Abundant gravels were also present for spawning. A culvert assessment was completed in 2023, along with a UAV flight survey. The road is failing near the culvert, and the pipe is exceptionally long. It is recommended that the crossing be replaced with an open bottom structure or a streambed simulation design. While this crossing poses more of a concern for fish migration, remediation is still recommended.",1236,CT;RB
Tributary to Knapper Creek ,198940_us,198940,us,,2024-09-18T19:46:37Z,AI,340,medium,high,"The stream was surveyed in the downstream direction, starting at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR, down to this crossing on road/spur HM7504, approximately 340 m. This section of stream provided medium-value habitat, with good flow, abundant gravels for spawning, and suitable rearing areas within undercut banks and occasional deep pools. Evidence of historic beaver activity is present throughout the area surveyed, including one large breached dam near the upstream end of the site. The riparian zone consists of a healthy shrub and herbaceous flood-tolerant plant community. The stream corridor is approximately 40–50 m wide, bordered by mature coniferous forest on both sides.  Electrofishing conducted at the upstream crossing on Gold Creek FSR captured rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and Dolly Varden.",1236,CT;RB
Simpson Creek,58245_ds,58245,ds,,2024-09-20T22:40:04Z,AI,70,medium,low,"The stream was surveyed for approximately 70 m from Lake Kathlyn Road to its confluence with Kathlyn Creek. It runs adjacent to the road on one side and private property on the other. Riparian vegetation is minimal on the private property side, with only shrubs present along the roadside. Multiple sections of bank armouring and channelization were observed near private land. Substrate consists primarily of fines and cobble, with only small pockets of gravel. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. ",1613,CO;CT;DV;MW;OS;RB;SA;ST

The upper 750 m of the stream is in relatively good condition, with mostly intact riparian vegetation, abundant gravels, deep pools, and large woody debris throughout. The lower 250–500 m is heavily impacted by adjacent private lands, with riparian vegetation removal, stream channelization, and bank armouring. Extensive beaver activity was observed within the lower ~300 m, with dams ranging from 0.4 to 1 m in height. An additional crossing was noted on private land just upstream of Lake Kathlyn Road on a driveway. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system.

Simpson Creek,58264_ds,58264,ds,,2024-09-20T15:34:47Z,AI,950,high,high,"The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road downstream to the railway, covering approximately 950 m. The upper 300 m from Nielsen Road has a steeper gradient of 5–6%, characterized by straight riffle-cascade sections with confined, channelized, dyke-like banks. Around 300 m downstream, the gradient decreases to 2–3%, transitioning into a ~50 m section with extensive aggraded material and multiple channels. Below this section, the habitat improves significantly, featuring extensive gravels, deep pools up to 90 cm, large woody debris, and diverse cover. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat upstream, particularly in the upper sections, within this known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road. The stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas, located south of the mapped channel.",,
Simpson Creek,58264_us,58264,us,,2024-09-27T20:07:53Z,AI LS JO JD,615,medium,high,"The stream was surveyed from Nielsen Road upstream for approximately 650 m, to roughly 200 m upstream of the powerlines. The stream had a steeper gradient with predominantly boulder cover and pockets of gravels suitable for coho, steelhead, and Dolly Varden spawning. Pools were infrequent. The upper end of the site was located just upstream of a short cascade with a 20% gradient. The riparian zone consisted of a healthy, mature mixed forest. This stream is a major contributor to the greater Kathlyn Creek watershed, with flow volumes during the assessment slightly less than the Kathlyn Creek mainstem. The stream provides high-value habitat, particularly below Nielsen Road, as this is a known steelhead, coho, and historically Chinook spawning system. The culvert on Nielsen Road has a significant outlet drop and likely limits fish passage. Electrofishing upstream of Nielsen Road captured rainbow trout, while downstream sampling confirmed the presence of Dolly Varden, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout/rainbow trout hybrids, and coho. The coho were captured approximately 350 m downstream of Nielsen Road.",,

# Purpose of this script

This scripts is used to backup the `form_fiss_site_2024.gpkg` file before QA in QGIS.

As of January 2025, we are now doing all pre-QA edits in QGIS instead of R, to reduce the amount of back and forth between Q and R. Most of the changes previously made in this script have been moved to `0210_fiss_export_to_template.Rmd`. 

## Fetch and backup the data

Update the `gis_project_name` and the `repo_name` in the YAML at the beginning of this script. 

Name the project directory we are pulling from and import the data. We use `fpr_sp_gpkg_backup` to import and backup the data, as well as update the UTMS. We will also write the data to a csv and Rdata file and commit for version control using git. Commit these inital backup files with a message such as "initial commit - raw 2024 data".

`update_site_id = TRUE` now checks for duplicate sites.

```{r import}
path_form_fiss_site_raw <- fs::path('~/Projects/gis/sern_skeena_2023/data_field/2024/form_fiss_site_2024_raw.gpkg')

form_fiss_site_raw <- fpr::fpr_sp_gpkg_backup(
  path_gpkg = path_form_fiss_site_raw,
  dir_backup = "data/backup/",
  update_utm = TRUE,
  update_site_id = FALSE, ## This now also checks for duplicates
  write_back_to_path = FALSE,
  write_to_csv = TRUE,
  write_to_rdata = TRUE,
  return_object = TRUE,
  col_easting = "utm_easting",
  col_northing = "utm_northing")
  
```


## Identify duplicate sites

Identify duplicate sites (that are not NAs) as we don't want to input two of the same. 
If there are duplicates go back to QGIS and clean up in `form_fiss_site_2024`.

Skeena 2024 - No duplicate sites found

```{r duplicates}
dups <- form_fiss_site_raw  |> 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(local_name)) |> 
  dplyr::group_by(local_name) |> 
  dplyr::filter(n()>1)
```


## QA in QGIS

The following should be done in QGIS:

- remove the site used to make the form (with `stream_name` set to `Robert Hatch`)
- back up the original assessment comments so we can redo this amalgamation of text if we need to. Use the field calculator, select generate new field, name it `assessment_comment_og`, and select `assessment_comment` in the expression box. 
- reorder the columns for easy QA in Q


## If you need to load an old version of a form

This is code to load an an old old version of a form and reburn to a geopackage 

```{r load-from-backup}

# Load the backup .Rdata file for the old version of the form
load("/Users/lucyschick/Projects/current/temp_fiss_backup/form_fiss_site_2024.RData")

form_fiss_old <- form_fiss_site_2024
rm(form_fiss_site_2024)

# Burn back to a geopackage
form_fiss_old |> 
  sf::st_write(path_form_fiss_site,
               append = FALSE,
               delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

# Session Info {-}

Information about the computing environment is important for reproducibility. A summary of the computing environment is saved to `session_info.csv`, which can be viewed and downloaded from `r ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$repo_url, url_resource = "blob/main/session_info.csv", anchor_text = "here")`.



```{r session-info}

if(gitbook_on){
  devtools::session_info(to_file = 'session_info.csv')
} else {
  devtools::session_info()
}

```

# Taman Creek - 197967 - Appendix {- #taman}


## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on the Bulkley River approximately 22.5km east of Topley, BC within the Bulkley River watershed group. The site is situated on Highway 16, approximately 2.5km upstream from Bulkley Lake. Although the stream is named the Bulkley River in the BC Freshwater Atlas, the stream at the highway is commonly referred to as Taman Creek (including on highway signage) as Taman Creek flows into this stream approximately 750m upstream of the highway. The culvert is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_hwy_structure_road_id 33227).

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

Detailed background for this site is available in @irvine2022BulkleyRiver related to the habitat confirmation conducted in 2021 which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/taman-creek---197967---appendix.html). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "bulk", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

<br>

Between 2022 and 2024, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure contracted Enviro-Ex Contracting Ltd. to replace the crossing with an extensive streambed simulation structure at a cost of $16,000,000 [@link2023Hwy16culvert]. The 3m wide un-embedded round culvert
was replaced with a 5.6m wide fully embedded round streambed simulation culvert. 

<br>

## Monitoring {.unnumbered}

In 2024, crews revisited the site for monitoring purposes, with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-monitoring-197967 - \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197967)).  The structure was well-constructed, with nearly 2m of embedded material within the new structure consisting of large boulders, cobbles, and gravels. Upstream, woody debris and boulder structures were cabled together within the reconstructed stream channel to provide habitat complexity and bank stabilization `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197967-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197967-d01)."))` This large-scale construction project involved substantial fill, extending for approximately 60m downstream and over 200m upstream.

Photos showing a comparison of the culvert assessment conducted in 2021 versus the completed replacement structure in 2024 are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197967-02) and Table \\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197967).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197967-d01)."))`

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

In 2024, conditions for upstream fish passage through the highway crossing at Taman Creek was greatly improved through installation of a streambed simulation structure featuring a large culvert width, embedded natural streambed substrates, and the addition of well
designed habitat features within the reconstructed channel. Future monitoring of the site could repeat monitoring metrics conducted in 
2024, track morphological changes to the channel in the years following construction and include fish sampling and/or eDNA presence surveys to understand fish use upstream and downstream of the crossing.

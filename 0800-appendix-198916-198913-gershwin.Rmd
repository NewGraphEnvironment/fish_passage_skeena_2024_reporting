## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`. This stream flows from an unnamed lake, first southwest and then northwest, before entering the Skeena River approximately 12.5 km southwest of the town of New Hazelton. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)` km upstream of the confluence of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` and the Skeena River, on the CN Railway. Approximately 900 m upstream, crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`. Both crossings are within the Kispiox River watershed group.

<br>


## Background {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198916)). 

<br>

In 2023, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments [@irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed]. These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream and fish documented immediately downstream of the Highway 16 crossing during the 2023 assessment [@irvine_schick2023SkeenaWatershed]. Previously,  `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been documented in the lake upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. 

<!-- Note about this site being "Skeena fisheries commission site with recommendation for installation of baffles" in 2023 assessment comments. Looked but haven't found more info about this, would be nice to include a bit more. -->

<br>

During the 2024 survey, two additional crossings were assessed. Approximately 1.3 km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, a crossing was assessed on Comeau Road (PSCIS crossing 203123). At this location, the stream had no visible channel and was determined to be unlikely to provide fish habitat.

<br>

Approximately 680 m upstream of the railway crossing, a small tributary flows into `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` from the north. In 2023, PSCIS crossing 198907 was assessed where this tributary intersects Braucher Road. At this location, the stream had moderate flow downstream with a well-defined channel, while the upstream channel was heavily overgrown and led to a wetland. In 2024, a second crossing on this tributary was assessed approximately 900 m further upstream on Comeau Road (PSCIS crossing 203124). Downstream of this crossing, the stream was described as a very small drainage.

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198916, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

Habitat modelling outputs from bcfishpass indicated 4.4 km of coho rearing habitat upstream of the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) and 1.7 km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) (gradients <5.5% for coho). However, the estimate for the railway crossing includes the tributary, which is unlikely to provide much habitat beyond the wetlands located 350 m upstream, just past PSCIS crossing 198907. Additionally, based on the assessment of the PSCIS crossing 203123 approximately 1.3 km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`), where the stream had no visible channel, a more conservative estimate of coho rearing habitat upstream of the Highway 16 crossing likely 1.3 km, while upstream of the railway crossing, it is approximately 2.3 km.

<br>

<!-- How can there be 1.7km of coho rearing (less than 5.5 %) but no steelhead rearing (less than 8.5 %). If there is 1.7km less than 5.5 % than there should also be 1.7km less than 8.5 km as well...  -->

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198916)). Constructed in the 1920s, this crossing is a concrete box culvert approximately 100 m in length, located beneath the CN railway with approximately 30â€“40 m of fill above it. It features a moderate 0.45 m outlet drop that adult fish could likely overcome but is presumed to act as a barrier to juvenile fish. The culvert's relatively steep 6% slope, minimal flow depths, and swift currents further impede fish passage. Installing baffles within the culvert would likely improve fish passage conditions.

<br>

PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198913)). Located on Highway 16, this crossing had a 0.35 m outlet drop and a significant 0.85 m deep outlet pool, suggesting the culvert is undersized for the stream.

<br>

At both crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. The stream contained numerous boulders forming step pools; however, moderate flows at the time of assessment limited the availability of pools suitable for fish. The first pool suitable for overwintering fish, with adequately reduced flow, was located approximately 250 m downstream of the culvert. There were occasional gravels suitable for spawning and frequent large woody debris, which contributed to the formation of additional steps. `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198916-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198916-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) upstream to the Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`), a distance of approximately 900 m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198916-02) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-01).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198916-d01)- \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-d01))."))` A large woody debris jam was observed approximately 250 m upstream of the railway crossing, creating a 17% gradient over a 9 m section due to a fallen tree. The stream maintained good flow through this steeper section, supported by a healthy, mature mixed riparian forest that stabilized the banks. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value and contained occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning by coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')`. The stream had frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with spawning gravels present despite a significant amount of fines. In the ~200 m section just upstream of the crossing, the stream maintains a low gradient and flows through agricultural fields, however, there were large cottonwoods providing sufficient riparian cover observed throughout the entire 600 m surveyed. Two logjams, each approximately 1 m in height, were observed but remain passable for fish  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-d01))."))``r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing an spawning. 

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted below and above the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198916) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198916) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198916). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` Dolly Varden were captured upstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198916-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-d02))."))` . 


Electrofishing was also conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing on Highway 16 (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198913) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198913) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198913). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream including Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` Dolly Varden were captured upstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198913-d02))."))` .

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the railway crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`. It is unlikely that fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River can access Gershwin Creek upstream of this railway crossing, and although construction would be expensive and challenging, this crossing is a high priority for restoration follow-up.


Until the downstream railway crossing is upgraded, replacement of the upstream crossing on Highway 16 (`r as.character(my_site2)`) is not recommended. If the downstream crossing is upgraded, the Highway 16 crossing should be replaced with a bridge spanning `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on Gershwin Creek which provides medium to high-value habitat for salmonids, including coho salmon, Dolly Varden, and cutthroat trout. Conservative estimates indicate approximately 2.3 km of coho rearing habitat upstream of the railway crossing and 1.3 km upstream of the Highway 16 crossing. 

Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on the CN Railway is a historic, exceptionally long concrete box culvert with approximately 30â€“40 m of fill above it. It has been identified as a barrier to juvenile fish passage due to its 0.45 m outlet drop, steep slope, and swift currents. This culvert likely inhibits fish from the mainstem of the Skeena River from accessing upstream habitats beyond this crossing. The site was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` priority for replacement, however, given the significant cost and scale of such a project, the installation of baffles is recommended as a more practical interim solution to improve fish passage conditions.

Replacement of the upstream Highway 16 crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) is recommended only if the downstream CN Railway crossing is first upgraded, as fish passage is otherwise restricted at the railway culvert. Collectively, these crossings form a critical passage for salmonid movement within the watershed. Restoration efforts should prioritize the downstream CN Railway crossing, as its improvement would unlock access to high-value rearing and spawning habitats further upstream.
